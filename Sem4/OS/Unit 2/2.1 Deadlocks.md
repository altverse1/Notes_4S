If two process are waiting on happening of some even which never happens, then we say that those process is said to be in a deadlock. 

In a system threads request for memory, once acquired they use it then release it after they are done. 

$$
REQUEST -> USE -> RETURN
$$
Deadlocks can occur when threads are waiting for an event. It occurs mainly during acquisition or release of a resource and when the event relies on the other threads in the set. 

Dining philosopher's problem illustrates this by saying if all philosophers grab the chopstick on the left, they will be blocked waiting for the chopstick on the right. 

Use of mutex locks is necessary but misuse can lead to deadlocks, where in multiple threads are waiting for resources. 


## Necessary Conditions for Deadlock

When all 4 are true then Deadlock can occur. 

### Multiple Exclusion 
If any 1 resource is held in a non-sharable mode(Only 1 thread can access at a time). If any other thread requests it, that thread must wait till the thread using it releases it. 

### No Preemption
Resources cannot be preempted. Only voluntary release post usage by thread is allowed. 

### Hold and Wait
A thread is holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional resources held by other threads.

### Circular Wait
Say, t0 is waiting for resource by held by t1, t1 is waiting for resource held by t2...... and tn is waiting for resource held by t0.





## Resource Allocation Graph

Its a representation that allows us to visualize resources usage and the possibility of deadlock

### Single Instance: 

>[!tip]
>Only in the case of single instance. If there is a cycle then it is a sure chance of deadlock. 

**Ex 1:** 

![[os_unit2.excalidraw#^group=gXIRaVSY|300x300]]

|Process|Allocated(R1,R2)|Requests(R1,R2)|
|--|--|--|
|P1|1,0|0,1|
|P2|0,1|1,0|
Availability = (0,0)

**How to use the method of checking deadlocks**(left to right): P1 has been allocated with 1 resource of R1 and 0 resource of R2. P1 requests 0 resource of R1 and 1 resource of R2. As 0 Resource of R1 and R2 are available. P1's request cannot be fulfilled.  

Therefore, neither P1's nor P2's request can be fulfilled.

**Ex 2:**

![[os_unit2.excalidraw#^group=JVE55iKXW4Cb4LmqQ6gtG|300x300]]

|Process|Allocated(R1,R2)|Requests(R1,R2)|
|--|--|--|
|P1|1,0|0,0|
|P2|0,1|0,0|
|P3|0,0|1,1|

Availability = (0,0) Initial
Availability = (1,0) Post P1
Availability = (1,1) Post P2

P1 & P2 do not request anything. Therefore upon their termination the resources R1 and R2 will get freed and P3 will be able to use them to carry out it's processes. 

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Therefore there is No DEADLOCK here</mark>


### Multi Instance 

**Ex1:**
![[os_unit2.excalidraw#^group=iLoxDg28W9d_3Y7_1pcYI|300x300]]

|Process|Allocated(R1,R2)|Requests(R1,R2)|
|--|--|--|
|P1|1,0|0,1|
|P2|0,1|1,0|
|P3|0,1|0,0|

Availability: (0,0) Init
Availability: (0,1) Post P3
Availability: (1,1) Post P1
Then P2 Executed


**Ex 2:**
![[os_unit2.excalidraw#^group=iPdupkJcUQk3tnYPIRMyR]]

|Process|Allocated(R1,R2,R3)|Requests(R1,R2,R3)|
|---|---|---|
|P0|1,0,1|0,1,1|
|P1|1,1,0|1,0,0|
|P2|0,1,0|0,0,1|
|P3|0,1,0|1,2,0|

Availability Graph:

|Step|R1|R2|R3|
|--|--|--|--|
|init|0|0|1|
|Post P2|0|1|1|
|Post P0|1|1|2|
|Post P1|2|2|2|
|Final P3|2|3|2|

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">No Deadlock.</mark>
