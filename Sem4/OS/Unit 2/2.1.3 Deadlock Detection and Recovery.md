## Deadlock Detection

If a system doesn't prevent a deadlock then it has to provide algorithms to Detect and resolve it.  

Two types of detection algorithms.

###  Single Instance
Wait for graph. Detects cycle. If cycle is there then resource is in deadlock state. 
The graph represents the dependencies between threads waiting for each other to release the resources they need. 
Periodic checks are made for cycles in the graph. The complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2)) where n is the number of threads.

###  Multiple Instance
An algorithm similar to Banker's Algorithm is used. 
Available: m, indicates number of available resources of each type.
Allocation: nxm matrix defines the number of resources allocated to each process.
Request: nxm indicates current request of each thread, if Request\[i]\[j] equals k, then process is requesting more resources. 

The algorithm:
1) Set the work vector similar to available vector, represents the number of available resources of each type. 
2) Find thread that has not finished and whose request can be satisfied by the available resources. If found proceed.
3) Add resources allocated to the thread to the available and mark the thread as finished, then go back to step 2.
4) If a thread exists that has not finished that means the system is in deadlocked state. 

Ex:

|Process|Allocation|Request||==Available(A,B,C)==|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|P1|0,1,0|0,0,0||0,0,0|
|P2|2,0,0|2,0,2|||
|P3|3,0,3|0,0,1|||
|P4|2,1,1|1,0,0|||
|P5|0,0,2|0,0,2|||

Here the system is in a deadlocked state and cannot proceed further.
If only P3 had made one less request of Resource C, we would not have had a deadlock.

### When to use Detection algorithm
- If deadlocks occur frequently, the deadlock-detection algorithm should be invoked frequently as well.
- Invoking the deadlock-detection algorithm at the time of a request helps identify the deadlocked threads and the specific thread that caused the deadlock.
- However, invoking the algorithm for every resource request can be computationally expensive.
- An alternative approach is to invoke the algorithm at defined intervals or when specific conditions are met, such as low CPU utilization.


## Deadlock Recovery

Deadlocks can be broken by aborting one or more processes/threads.
We can either abort all processes stuck in a deadlock or starting by eliminating them one by one till deadlock is resolved.

Elimination of all can be expensive as it might lead to left out computation and may require recomputation. 

One by one elimination may cause overhead as detection algorithm needs to run after each termination. 

Priority, progress of computation, resource usage and termination cost plays a role while elimination of processes.


### Preemption 
Another way.
Involves preempting the resource and allocating them to others. This way we can prevent starvation. 
A process is chosen(victim) upon the cost of resource held etc. It gets preempted and after others are done with the resources the victim is rolled back to it's previous state(safe state, where it has all resources needed for its execution) and then restart it. 
Total rollback is inefficient but simple. Selective rollback require more information about the process's state. 
Starvation prevention ensures same process is not always the victim. This can be done by assessing the number of times a process has been rolled back and setting a limit on that.
