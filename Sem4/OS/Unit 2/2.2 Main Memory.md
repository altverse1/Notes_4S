## Basics

- Program must be brought (from disk)  into memory and placed within a process for it to be run
- Main memory and registers are only storage CPU can access directly
- Memory unit only sees a stream of:
	- Addresses + read requests, or
	- address + data and write requests
- Register access is done in one CPU clock (or less)
- Main memory can take many cycles, causing a stall
- Cache sits between main memory and CPU registers
- Protection of memory required to ensure correct operation

### Protection
- Need to ensure that a process can access only those addresses in its address space.
- We can provide this protection by using  a pair of base and limit registers define the logical address space of a process

### Hardware Address Protection

CPU must check every memory access generated in user mode to be sure it is between base and limit for that user.


### Address Binding

>[!info]-
>- Program execution requires bringing the program into memory and placing it within a process context.
>- The process accesses instructions and data from memory during execution.
>- The process terminates, and its memory is reclaimed for other processes.
>- The program goes through several steps before execution, including compilation, linking/loading, and execution.

Address binding refers to the process of associating instructions and data in a program with specific memory addresses. 

Types:
- Compile time binding generates absolute code if the memory location is known.
- Load time binding generates relocatable code if the memory location is not known at compile time.
- Execution time binding allows for the process to be moved during execution and requires special hardware support.
Different methods of address binding have trade-offs in terms of flexibility and performance.

## Logical vs Physical Address

An address generated by the CPU is called a logical address, whereas the address seen by the memory unit is called a physical address.

Address binding at compile or load time results in identical logical and physical addresses.
Execution-time address binding results in differing logical and physical addresses, with logical addresses referred to as virtual addresses.
The mapping from virtual to physical addresses is done by the memory-management unit (MMU).
Logical addresses are in the range 0 to max, while physical addresses are in the range R + 0 to R + max (where R is the base value).


## Misarranged Terms

1. Non-contiguous: In the context of memory management, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">non-contiguous refers to the allocation of memory that is not consecutive or contiguous.</mark> Instead of allocating a continuous block of physical memory to a process, non-contiguous memory management schemes allocate memory in separate, scattered blocks. This allows for more efficient memory utilization and flexibility in allocating memory to processes.
    
2. Fragmentation: Fragmentation refers to the phenomenon where memory becomes divided into small, non-contiguous blocks, making it challenging to allocate contiguous memory space to satisfy larger memory requests. There are two types of fragmentation:
    
    - External Fragmentation: External fragmentation occurs when free memory blocks are scattered throughout the system, making it difficult to allocate a contiguous block of memory to satisfy a process's memory request. It reduces the overall memory utilization.
        
    - Internal Fragmentation: Internal fragmentation occurs when allocated memory blocks are larger than necessary, resulting in wasted memory within each block. It happens when memory is allocated in fixed-size units, and a process doesn't fully utilize the allocated block.
        
3. Compaction: Compaction is a technique used to eliminate external fragmentation by rearranging memory to create larger contiguous blocks of free memory. It involves moving allocated memory blocks and adjusting memory addresses to fill the gaps between them. Compaction is typically used in memory management schemes where memory allocation is contiguous, such as in systems with fixed partitioning. However, compaction can be time-consuming and may introduce overhead.
