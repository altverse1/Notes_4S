Its a memory management technique where the secondary memory can be used alongside the main memory. CPU executes a process if it is in main memory only. Program of size 10GB will not fit in the main memory of size 4GB. That's why the OS will make use of Virtual Memory.


## Virtual Memory using Demand Paging

When demand arise for a page, OS loads said page into the main memory. When a page is not needed it stays in the secondary storage. The concept is similar to paging with swapping. We use a lazy swapper, which only loads a page into memory if it is needed.

### When pages are not in Main Memory

Here the valid invalid bit tells wether the page is in memory or not. 
V-> it's there
i -> it's not there.


### Page Fault

CPU checks if page is in main memory or not. If it was not brought into the main memory then it is called as <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Page Fault</mark>. Some steps are taken to help the system:
![[os_pgfault.png|450]]
Handling Page Fault:
1. CPU checks if the memory access is valid or invalid by referring to the page table associated with the process.
2. If page is not present in the memory, CPU generate an interrupt called Trap to the OS 
3. OS checks where the page is in the secondary memory.
4. OS loads the page from secondary memory to a free frame in the main memory. 
5. The page table is updated, the valid-invalid bit is set to valid.
6. The process of execution is restarted. 

Restart the instruction that caused the page fault. The process can now access the page as if it had always been in memory.

Some things to note:
- Page table here is capable of marking an entry invalid/valid.
- Secondary memory holds pages that are not in the main memory, it is also called a swap device.
- Restarting of process: When the interrupt occurs it can happen at two instances, at the start during instruction fetch(Fix the fault and re-fetch the instruction) or while fetching an operand(fix the fault, and redo the entire set of instructions from scratch once again). 


## Copy On Write

Technique for rapid process creation and minimization of newer pages for new process.
Copy on write allows the parent and child process to share the same pages initially. If either of the parent or child process writes to the page, a copy of the shared page is created and is mapped to address space of the process that modified it.


## Page replacement: 
Whenever page fault occurs CPU gets the page form the secondary memory. But if the main memory is full, then we have replace the pages in the main memory with new page of the secondary memory. 

![[os_pgreplace.png|500]]

We first have to select a victim from the main memory and swap it out to the secondary memory. After swapping we have to update the page table by making the valid-invalid bit to invalid for that page. 

We then swap in the required page from secondary page, to the main memory. After brining it to the main memory we have to update the page table by setting the valid-invalid bit of that page to valid.


## Page Replacement Algorithms

We compare the page faults vs the number of frames to analyze the algorithms.


### First In First Out (FIFO)

It associates the time that the page was brought into memory. The oldest pages is chosen to get replaced. 

For the following reference string: 
7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 7, 0, 1
![[os_pgfifo.png]]
Blue lines indicate that string is in the frame.
The red underline indicates the oldest. 

Step:
- Initially the frames in memory are empty.
- When a page is referenced due to a page fault it is brought into an empty frame.
- When all frames get filled the oldest page gets replaced with the new page.
- The process continues as pages are referenced with page faults.

The problem here is, if the page is actively used but gets replaced with some new page we end up causing even more faults and hence a slower execution. This is called the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Belady's Anomaly</mark>, where increasing number of frames can increase the number of page faults. 
Contrary to the expectation that increasing memory would improve performance, in some cases, the number of page faults actually increases when more memory frames are allocated.

The algorithm is simple but may not always give the best performance. 


### Optimal Algorithm

It is a algorithm that achieves lowest possible page fault rate. It is based on replacing the page that will not be used for the longest period of time. Implementation is tricky because we need to know which reference string will not be used frequently in the near future. 

Frame size = 3
![[os_pgopt.png]]
Blue lines show that reference is there in the memory. 

Here at reference of 2, 7 will not be used for the longest period of time then 1 then 0(will be used soon). Hence we replace 7. 


### Least Recently Used(LRU) Algorithm 

As it is hard to predict which reference string will not be used in the execution in Optimal Algorithm. We use LRU.

Least recently used (LRU) algorithm: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">replaces the page that has not been used for the longest period of time </mark>based on recent past references.

Frame Size = 3
![[os_pglru.png]]

Blue lines show that reference is there in the memory. 
Here for the reference of 2, 1 is the most recently used and 7 is the least recently used reference. Hence we replace 7 with 2.

This algorithm may require hardware assistance like counters/stack to track the time of last used page.



### LRU approximation Algorithms

The hardware provides us with reference bits, these tell us which pages have been used and not used in an unordered way.


#### Additional Reference Bits Algorithms
For each page. We record reference bits here at regular intervals. An additional 8 bit byte is used to store the history of the page use in the last 8 time periods.
If shift register contains:
00000000 = Never used
11111111 = Used for all 8 periods.
A page with a register value of 11000100 has been used more recently than one with a value of 01110111.
The LRU here would be the lowest value in the shift register. 


#### Secondary Chance Algorithm
Reference bit is pre-set to a certain value by the system based on the page's usefulness.

If reference bit = 0 (Replace the page)
If reference bit = 1(Give it another chance, replace some other page). Reset arrival time to current time.
The Second-Chance Algorithm can be implemented using a circular queue.
- A pointer indicates which page is to be replaced next, and it advances until it finds a page with a reference bit of 0.
- As the pointer advances, it clears the reference bits.
- Once a victim page is found, it is replaced, and the new page is inserted in the circular queue in that position.

If a page has to be set to never be replaced we can keep setting the reference bit to 1.

after all the reference bits are set to 0 they will get replaced and hence the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Second-Chance Algorithm degenerates into FIFO</mark> replacement because there are no pages eligible for immediate replacement based on the reference bit.

#### Enhanced Second-Chance Algorithm (Not there LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO)
It considers both the reference bit and the modify bit as an ordered pair to determine the class of each page.

There are four possible classes:
- (0, 0) represents pages that are neither recently used nor modified and are considered the best pages to replace.
- (0, 1) represents pages that are not recently used but have been modified, requiring them to be written out before replacement.
- (1, 0) represents pages that are recently used but clean, indicating that they will likely be used again soon.
- (1, 1) represents pages that are recently used and modified, indicating that they will likely be used again soon and require writing out to secondary storage before replacement.

We replace the first page encountered in the lowest nonempty class.
