Memory Management scheme that permits the physical address space of a process to be non-contagious. Avoids external fragmentation and the need of compaction.

![[os_page1.png|400x400]]

Logical Memory/Process is divided into pages. The physical memory is divided into frames.
Each page has a fixed size. 
Each frame is of same size.
Size of frame == Size of page.

When CPU has to load a process(let the process contain four pages page0,page1,page2,page3) the pages of the secondary memory has to be loaded into the main memory. 

A page table is used. It accepts page number as the input and it produces frame number as the output.


## Paging Hardware


![[os_page.png]]

In order to execute any instruction CPU generates logical address for the instruction. The logical address is divided into two parts 

|Page Number|Page Offset|
|--|--|
|p|d|

d = displacement.

Ex:

|Page0 |
|--------|
|    0     |
|    1     |
|   ...â€¦. |
|    n     |

Page table accepts page number as input. Outputs the frame number as output.

Frame Number+Offset = **Physical Address**


Examples Of Paging FOR a 32 byte memory with 4 byte pages. 

There are a total of 32/4= 8 Frames

1) For logical address = 0: page no. = 0, offset = 0, page 0 is in frame 5, meaning it is at physical address of 20 ((5x4)+0)
2) For Logical address = 3: page no. = 0, offset = 3, physical address = 23((5x4)+3)
3) For Logical address=4: page no. =1, offset =0, physical address = 24 ((6x4)+0)

![[os_pg2.png]]

Paging avoid external fragmentation. But internal fragmentation is possible. 

Ex: if page size = 2kb, and a process needs 72KB we need 35 pages + 1 (1KB/1086B) page. i.e. 36 Frames. 
Internal fragmentation = 2048-1086 = 962bytes. 


### Hardware support

Page table cannot be stored in the super fast CPU registers due the size limitations of the registers. So the only feasible option is to store them in the main memory.  

Therefore we need 2 memory access. 
1. To access page table.(Frame no.)
2. To access the data instruction.(Offset.)


#### Translation Look-aside Buffer(TLB)
It's Faster, smaller cache(register), which can store larger data. 
It is a associative memory where information is stored in two parts, where first component of the key/tag and second component is value.
![[os_tlb.png]]
Let page table contain 1000 pages out of those the most frequently accessed are stored int the TLB. 

TLB hit means corresponding page number is found in TLB. If not found(TLB miss) page table will receive the input which will then output the frame number. 

We then add this new page number, frame number pair to the TLB for easy access for the next time. If TLB gets full then OS removes the lesser used one and inserts our new one. 

Hit ratio is the number of times a page number is found in the TLB. Desired TLB = 80%. 


#### Paging Protection 

Memory protection is done by protection bits associated with each frame. Normally these bits are kept in the page table.

V - Valid. (1)
I - Invalid. (0)

One bit can define a page as read-write and read-only.
It checks wether the no writes are being made to a read only page.

### Shared Pages

It allows sharing of common code among multiple processes. In a system with multi users the code of a program(like text editor) can be shared.

If the text editor requires 150KB of memory and the user's data requires 50KB and about 100 users are using said application. Then to total storage is (150+50)\*100 = 20000KB

Instead we can have only one copy of 150KB of data for the text editor and 100 copies of user space. Which reduces the total needed memory to 5150. 

Other heavily used programs can also be shared, improving memory utilization and system efficiency.

## Structure Of Page Table

Say for a system with logical address of 32 bits the size of the page is 4KB i.e. 2^2 \* 2^10 = 2^12.

Logical address is divided into two parts 

|Page no.|Offset|
|---|---|

Hence offset(d) = 12 and the size of the page no. is 32-12 = 20 bits. Such a system can store up to 1 Million entries. We possibly cant allocate the page table contagiously in the main memory.

The solution is to divide the page table into smaller pieces. 


### Hierarchical Paging

![[_excalidraw_/os_unit2.excalidraw.md#^group=8ti07wVwugmVu6qQckFEv|700x300]]
Here we split the page number into two parts(page the page table). P1 refers to the index of the outer page table and P2 is used to get the frame number from within the inner page table. Here as the address transition works from outer to inner hence it is called forward mapped page table. 

#### Two level Page Tables 
The page table is divided into multiple levels. The outer page table corresponds to the higher-level division, and the inner page table corresponds to the lower-level division. Each level of the page table helps in mapping a portion of the logical address to the physical address.

![[os_2lvpage.png|500x400]]

#### Three Level Paging 

For 64 bit logical address space a two level paging scheme is no longer useable. If page size is 4KB (2^12) then page table will end up with 2^52 entries. 

If we use a two level then:

|Outer(p1)|Inner(p2)|Offset(d)|
|--|--|--|
|42|10|12|
42 entries in outer page table is quite a lot.

So we divide it even further.

|2nd Outer(p1)|Outer(p2)|Inner(p3)|Offset(d)|
|--|--|--|--|
|32|10|10|12|



### Hashed Page Table

Another approach to handle address spaces larger than 32 bits. The worst case of hashing is O(1). Hence it is very useful.

![[os_pghash.png]]

The page number will be given to a hash function which gives a has value that is mapped to the hash location in the hash table. Each location in the table contains a linked list(separate chaining) to prevent collision. 

The link list contains three fields
- Virtual page number
- Frame number
- Pointer to the next element in ll. 

Frame number is given as the output. This is done by: 
Size of hash table is 100. The hash function is modulo operation.
Say the logical address produces p = 432
Therefore the hash function produces 432%100 = 32
We check the 23rd index of the hash table for Virtual page number = 432 in the linked list. 

### Inverted Page Tables

![[os_pginvert.png]]

In traditional page table structures, each process has its own page table with one entry for each page used by the process. This approach can result in large page tables, consuming significant amounts of physical memory, as if there are 100 process each with 100 pages a lot of main memory gets consumed. 

To resolve this issue we use inverted page table. Where there is only one entry for each physical frame in memory. 

An entry in page table in such systems consists of processID(pid) and page number(p). 

When memory reference occurs, pid and p is given to page table, and for the corresponding pid and page numbre we get a frame number.
