
## Allocation of Frames
**Minimum Number of Frames:**
- Allocating an adequate number of frames to processes is important for good performance. Fewer frames result in more page faults and slower execution.
- Page faults that occur during the execution of an instruction lead to instruction restart, which slows down the process.
- Depending on the computer architecture, a minimum number of frames is required. In some cases, this number is influenced by levels of indirection.

**Allocation Algorithms:**
- The simplest way to divide frames among processes is by equal allocation, where each process gets an equal share.
- Proportional allocation allocates memory based on process size. The bigger the process, the more frames it gets.
- In proportional allocation, we adjust the allocation based on process needs while ensuring a balance with available memory.

**Global vs. Local Allocation:**
- Page-replacement algorithms fall into two categories: global replacement and local replacement.
- Global replacement allows a process to take frames from other processes, potentially affecting their page fault rates.
- Local replacement lets each process choose only from its own allocated frames, resulting in more control over its page fault rate.
- While global replacement can improve system throughput, local replacement provides better predictability of page fault behavior.

**Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA):**
- In systems with multiple CPUs, memory access times may vary across different parts of memory.
- NUMA systems consist of multiple system boards, each with CPUs and memory. CPUs can access their own board's memory faster than others'.
- Managing page frame allocation to CPUs can greatly impact performance in NUMA systems.
- Algorithms aim to allocate memory frames close to the CPU where a process is scheduled, improving cache hits and reducing memory access times. 



## Trashing

- Thrashing is a term used to describe a situation in which a computer system is overwhelmed by excessive paging activity, leading to poor performance.
- When a process spends more time swapping pages between memory and disk than actually executing, it's considered to be thrashing.

**Cause of Thrashing:**
- If the CPU utilization is low, the operating system might introduce new processes to increase the degree of multiprogramming.
- If a global page-replacement algorithm is used, a process may start taking frames from other processes, leading to page faults.
- These page-faulting processes also need frames, causing more page faults and leading to a cycle of processes waiting for the paging device.
- As the CPU utilization decreases due to waiting processes, the CPU scheduler tries to increase the degree of multiprogramming, which worsens the situation, causing thrashing.
- Thrashing results in a high page-fault rate and decreased system throughput.

**Working-Set Model:**
- The working-set model aims to prevent thrashing by approximating the locality of a program's memory references.
- It defines a working set as the set of pages referenced in the most recent Δ page references, where Δ is a parameter representing a time window.
- Active pages stay in the working set, while pages no longer in use drop out of it after Δ time units.
- The working set is an approximation of a program's current memory needs.

**Keeping Track of the Working Set:**
- The size of the working set is crucial. If the sum of working-set sizes exceeds the total available frames, thrashing can occur.
- To prevent thrashing, if the sum of working-set sizes surpasses available frames, the operating system may suspend a process, write its pages to disk, and reallocate its frames to other processes.

**Page-Fault Frequency:**
- High page-fault rate indicates thrashing, where pages are constantly being swapped.
- Controlling page-fault rate is important. If it's too high, a process needs more frames; if too low, it might have excess frames.
- Upper and lower bounds on desired page-fault rates can be established. If the actual rate exceeds the upper limit, allocate the process more frames. If it falls below the lower limit, remove frames to control thrashing.
