A secure system is such which where the information and resources are inaccessible under all circumstances to any third party. 

## The security problem

Security violations are of two types: 
- Accidental
- Malicious

### Violations:

**- Breach of confidentiality:** 
	Unauthorized reading of data. The aim is to acquire secret data from the system or data stream. Like: Credit card info, identity, unreleased movies, scripts plans etc. 
 
**- Breach of integrity:** 
	Modification of data like source code causing damage to the entity owning the data.

**- Breach of availability:** 
	Destruction of data. By wreaking havoc and disrupting services. Like bringing down  a website.

**- Theft of service**
	Unauthorized use of resource. Like using another persons system to conduct attacks or mine bitcoin on.

**- Denial of service**
	DOS. Preventing the use of system by eating up resources. Worms do that.


### Common attacks

**- Masquerading:**
	Pretending to be an authorized user to escalate privileges.
**- Replay attack:**
**- Man in the middle attack:** 
	Attacker sits in the middle and gets information through the data flow. Or masquerading as the sender or receiver. 
	**- Session hijacking:**
		Active session is interrupted. 
**- Privilege escalation:**
	Attempting to get more privileges to attain states that allow for deadlier attacks on the system.


### Protection
100% Protection is not possible. But increase the protection is.

#### Level of Security measures: 
- **Physical:**
	The sites containing the very system must be in a secure place. Like the hard-drives, machine rooms. Limiting the access to such locations with security and authentication is necessary in case of servers etc.
	
- **Network:**
	Connected systems pose a greater threat of getting infected incase one system gets infected. Such network streams are also prone to DOS and other masquerading attacks. Such systems must ensure firewalls are in place.

- **Operating system:**
	Improper settings, bugs are problematic and open doorways for attackers to harm the system. Patching and keeping up to date protections systems and performing routine checks for activity is necessary.

- **Application:**
	Installed applications already have certain privileges. Modification to code and bugs within the application pose a great risk to the system. Closed sourced applications can face great risk too.
