## Malware

A software designed to exploit, disable or damage computer systems. 

### Major Types of Malware

#### Trojan Horse
It is a broad category of malware that disguises itself as legit software or files that aim to deceive user into executing it, which then begin its malicious actions without the users knowledge. These actions include, stealing sensitive information, providing unauthorized access to attacker and damaging the system. 

##### Spyware
It is a trojan horse that aims to spy on user's activites on a computer without consent. It enters the system via freeware programs. They can track user key strokes(key logger), steal sensitive information, get browsing history. It then sends this information to remote attacker who uses it for targeted advertising or gaining access to the system.

##### Ransomware
These encrypt the user's files and proceed to ask for money usually in the form of crypto currency. Upon paying it may or may not provide a decryption key to unlock the files. They impact the users or businesses by locking them of their own data.


#### Trap Door
Security Vulnerabilities left bey software designer to provide unauthorized access to a program or a system.
It can involve certain conditions like certain combos of passwords and usernames that can allow the user to bypass normal security measures.
Programmers have used this for their financial gains.

##### Logic Bomb
Under specific logic conditions we can activate a trap door. In such cases a trapdoor is called a logic bomb.
These trapdoors remain dormant for a long time and suddenly sprung into action.

##### Compiler Based Trapdoor
A compromised compiler can generate code along with trapdoor. Existing libraries can be patched/updated which can result in this. The most notable example is XCode Ghost malware which affected software devs.

##### Preventing Trapdoors
- Analysing all source code components. Expensive for large software.
- Use of version control tools can be of use such as GIT etc. 
- Code reviews of code written is submitted to other devs for review process before committing. 


## Viruses and Worms
Fragment of code embedded into genuine programs. These try to infect other computers. They damage the system by modifying and destroying files which can cause system crashes.

Viruses are architecture, OS specific. 

These mainly targes majority market share systems like Android and Windows.

### Spread  
Viruses spread to spam email, phishing attacks, downloading viral programs or sharing infected drives.

Viruses spread can be of two forms:
- Require Human Activity.
- Spread through the network via worms.

### Types of Viruses

- **File Virus:** Appends itself to a file, altering the program's start so that execution jumps to its code. Leaves no full files behind.
- **Boot Virus:** Infects the boot sector, executing during system boot before the OS loads. Spreads to other bootable media.

- **Macro Virus:** Written in a high-level language (e.g., Visual Basic) and triggered when a program capable of executing macros runs.
- **Rootkit:** Infiltrates the OS itself, compromising the entire system's functions and facilitating its own detection evasion.
- **Source Code Virus:** Modifies source code to include and spread the virus.
- **Polymorphic Virus:** Alters its code each time to evade antivirus detection.
- **Encrypted Virus:** Contains decryption code alongside the encrypted virus to avoid detection. Virus first decrypts then executes. 
- **Stealth Virus:** Modifies parts of the system that could detect it to avoid discovery.
- **Multipartite Virus:** Infects multiple parts of the system, making detection and containment difficult.
- **Armored Virus:** Obfuscated, compressed, or hidden to make it hard for antivirus researchers to understand.

### Variety and Impact 
Viruses continue to evolve and grow in numbers. Its creators try to exploit bugs in the OS. They try to affect personal computers, Windows servers etc, then proceed to install key loggers to collect data, give remote access to systems and then infect other computers by exploiting trust by sending through mail etc.  

#### Additional Stuff:
Monoculture: Running of same software stack across systems. Like Microsoft products within Microsoft products could increase vulnerability. 


## Code Injection

Code injection focusing on buffer overflow attacks. 
It involves modifying executable code to compromise a software's behavior. These are targeted at languages like C & C++ which allow direct memory access. 
Vulnerable functions like `strcpy()`, `sprintf()`, and `gets()` are  few examples.

A buffer overflow attack happens when a program starts writing data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

This can cause:
- **Memory Corruption**: By writing data beyond allocated region we may write important data to other regions of the memory that parts of the program cannot access. This may or may not cause crashes.
- **Control Flow Hijacking**: If the overflow overwrites the return address of a function on the call stack then the attacker control the program by diverting execution to a malicious injected code(shell code). 
- **Shell Code**: Injected code, this can give them access to sensitive data or compromise security of the system. 

These attacks significant depth of knowledge to exploit but a script kiddie can access the exploit and launch these attacks.

These attacks tend to be dangerous as they can bypass firewalls and travel over the network.
