## The Problems

### Readers-Writers Problem
In a scenario where multiple processes want to access a shared database, some processes might only want to read the data while others want to both read and modify it. The challenge is to ensure that readers can access the data simultaneously without causing any problems. However, when a writer accesses the data for modification, it needs exclusive access to prevent conflicts. The readers-writers problem involves finding a way to manage these different types of accesses without causing issues like data inconsistency.
 
### Dining-Philosophers Problem
Imagine five philosophers sitting around a circular table, each thinking and occasionally wanting to eat. They share chopsticks that are placed between them. However, a philosopher can only eat if they have both chopsticks. The challenge is to ensure that they can eat without causing deadlock (where they all wait for chopsticks indefinitely) or resource contention (where they try to grab the same chopstick at the same time).
