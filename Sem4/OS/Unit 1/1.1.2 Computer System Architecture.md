
Types of computer system based on number of General Purpose Processors

1) Single Processor
2) Multi Processor 
3) Clustered Systems


## Single Processor 

* One main CPU capable of executing a **general purpose** instruction set.  
* Other special processor present which perform device **specific task**. (Microprocessor)

## Multi Processor

Aka. Parallel Systems or tightly coupled systems
* Has two or more processor placed close to each other in order to share bus, clock, memory and other peripheral devices.

**Advantages:**
1) Increased performance
2) Economy of scale
3) Increased Reliability

### Types of Multiprocessing system

1) Symmetric Multiprocessing 
	Similar CPU, all do same task.

2) Asymmetric Multiprocessing
	Master-Slave approach. One processor(master) manages others(slave). Each slave processor takes care of one process. 


## Clustered Systems

Clustered systems gather together multiple CPUs to accomplish computational work.
* 2 or more individual systems are coupled together.
* Provides High availability.

Can be constructed in asymmetric or symmetric mode.
