## Process Concept 

Process is a program in execution. 

Memory layout of process is like:
- Text Section - The executable code
- Data Section - Global Variables
- Heap Section - Dynamically allocated memory during program run time.
- Stack Section - Temporary Data Storage when invoking functions

Program (Executable) is a passive entity stored on the disk. When it's a process it is active. This happens when exe is loaded into memory. This can happen by GUI mouse click/ command line entry of it's name. 

Two processes can be associated with same program. Ex: Multiple instances of the program created by multiple users. 



## Process State

A process at any moment can be in any of these states:
- New - Process is being created.
- Running - Instructions are being executed.
- Waiting - The process is waiting for some event to occur. Like an signal etc.
- Ready - The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
- Terminated - The process has finished executing.

### Process Control Block

Process control block aka task control block. 
Contains info associated with a process:


|PCB||Info Associated|
|--|--|--|
|Process State||The state may be new, ready...(mentioned above)|
|Process Number||It is the ProcessID|
|Program Counter||It indicates the address of the next instruction of the process|
|CPU Registers||Controls Process centric registers, saves state in case of interrupt|
||CPU Scheduling Information|Process priority and pointers to scheduling queues|
|Memory Limits|Memory Management|Info regarding value of base and limit registers.|
||Accounting Information|Time used, cpu used, time limits, process numbers|
|List of Open Files/ IO status||List of files open and I/O devices with process etc.|
|---|||

### Threads

Previously process could do only one task at a time. But nowadays multithreading allows a process to have multiple threads of execution. Hence allowing process to do multiple tasks at the same time. Useful in computers with multiple cores, allowing threads to run in parallel.
