Source Code is compiled into object files designed to be loaded into any physical memory location aka Relocatable Object File.

Linker combines these object files into a single binary executable file. With libraries necessary included. Program resides in secondary storage and binary file
![[os_linkload.png|500x500]]

To get into RAM loader is used. Relocation happens, where code is adjusted to match final addresses. 

Dynamically Linked Libraries are loaded as needed. 

Object, executables have standard format hence the OS knows how to load and start them. 


### Why are applications OS specific
Apps executable in one OS aren't executable in another OS.
Each OS has unique system calls and file formats. 

But to make Apps muti OS compatible we can:
- Written in languages like Python, ruby which use interpreters.
- Written in languages like Java that has a VM included for running the code.
- Using languages like C and compiling separately on each run.


Application Binary Interface: Architecture Equivalent of API.


## Design and implementation of OS

Define goals and specification
1) Affected by user's choice of hardware and type of system.
2) Goals can be:
	- User Goals: Convenient to use, easy to learn, safe, fast.
	- System Goals: Easy to design and debug and maintain. Efficient and error free.

### Implementation

- Choice of language: Can be assembly(old days), Algol or can use wildly used languages like C, C++. 
	- Mix of languages possible too:
		- Low level = Assembly
		- Main body = C
		- System Program = C, C++, Python scripts etc..

Emulation can allow OS to run on non native hardware. 
Operating system can be implemented in high level language as the writing would be faster and compact, which makes it easier to understand and debug. The only disadvantage would be reduced speed, this however isn't the case in modern day OS.
