General Purpose OS is a very large program. That's why it needs a structure. 

## Monolithic Structure

A monolithic operating system has no structure; all functionality is provided in a single, static binary file that runs in a single address space. Although such systems are difficult to modify and implement, they carry a major benefit of efficiency. Changes in one part of the system can result in wide variety of changes in another part of the system too. These systems tend to be harder to extend too.

## Layered Approach

A layered operating system is divided into a number of discrete layers, where the bottom layer is the hardware interface and the highest layer is the user interface. 
Each layer consists of data that can be accessed by the higher layers.

Although layered software systems have had some success such as:
- Easier debugging due to simplicity
- Enhanced abstraction(hiding structures)
this approach is generally not ideal for designing operating systems due to performance problems. But it can be used in networks.

## Micro Kernels

Introduced by Mach OS. It modularizes non essential components as User level programs in separate address spaces. Resulting in a smaller kernel and easier extensibility. Communication between client and services occur via message passing. 
This OS structure has been known to face performance issues. Windows moved from Microkernel to a more monolithic structure. 


## Modules

LKMs Loadable Kernel Modules is a popular method of OS design. Allow services to be linked and delinked to kernel dynamically even while service is running all this happens without sacrificing performance. Linux regularly uses LKMs for device drivers and file systems.  


## Hybrid

OS adopt hybrid structure to enhance functionality and performance. For ex: Linux is largely monolithic but allows modules that can be dynamically linked. Windows also is monolithic but allows microkernel systems like subsystems and support for loadable kernel modules.

## System Boot 

The process of loading the OS is called Booting. 
Process of Booting:
- Bootstrap program/boot loader locates the kernel(core of OS).
- Kernel is loaded into memory and started. 
- Kernel initializes the hardware.
- Essential files are mounted and made ready.

Modern systems do this in a slightly different way:
- The small bootloader loads a more sophisticated boot loader from the boot block of the disk.
- This second stage then goes and loads the OS.
	Ex: GRUB of Linux

Bootloaders also allow choosing different OS in case of dual booted systems. Also providing recovery mode in case of boot failure. 


## Debugging

It is the process of finding and fixing error in system. It includes finding and resolving problems in hardware and software.

Errors are logged by the OS in case of failure of the process/application and also creates a memory snapshot for further analysis. (Core Dump)

In case of Kernel failure the memory snapshot is called crash dump. Debugging the kernel is more complicated as it controls the hardware.



## Performance Tuning 

Process of improving system performance by resolving issues before they accumulate is performance tuning. 
System monitors system behavior and the observations are made via counters or tracing techniques. 
Counters are used to track system activity such as number of system calls. Tracing techniques are used to collect data about certain events.

OS must provide tools that display system behavior to the users. Windows does so by using showing a Task Manager.
