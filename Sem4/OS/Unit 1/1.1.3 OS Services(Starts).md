OS provides an environment for execution of programs and services to programs and users.

Useful OS services:

- User Interface - GUI, CLI, Touch Screen
- Program Execution - Load prog into memory, execute, terminate, report error in case of abnormal execution.
- I/O Operations - Managing I/O files and devices.
- File System Manipulation - Programs need to read and write files and directories, create and delete them, search them, list information etc...
- Communications - Info exchange on the computer or on the network via shared mem/ message passing.
- Err Detection - OS should be aware of possible errs.
	- May occur anywhere. 
	- OS correct them
	- Debugging facilities for user/programmer experience enhancement.

For Efficient operation via resource sharing:
- Resource Allocation: Multiple jobs running, resources must be allocated to all of them.
- Logging: Track which users use how much resources.
- Protection & Security: 
	- Protection: Access to system resources is controlled
	- Security: Outsider requires user authentication, defending external I/O devices from invalid access.


## Basic UIs

### CLI
It allows command entry by user/application which gets executed. Is Implimented in kernel, system program and comes in flavors(shells).

### GUI
User friendly desktop interface. 
	Has icons, that represent programs, actions etc. 
	Actions over various object display various information and open files, execute programs etc.
	Controlled via mouse, keyboard and monitor.

Windows comes with CMD(CLI) and a GUI
Same with Mac OS X with Aqua GUI and Unix Kernel. Similarly for Linux GUI(KDR, GNOME etc.).

### Touch Screen GUI
Virtual Keyboard, Gestures and voice commands


## System Calls

Provide an interface to the services made available by an operating system.
- Written in high level languages Like C and C++
- Accessed by an API instead of a direct call.
- Win32 API for Windows POSIX API for UNIX based.

Example:

> Example Of System Call To copy contents of one file to another.

Check Example of standard API


### System Call Implementation

A number is associated with each system call. System call interface maintains a table indexed according to these numbers. 
Sys call interface invokes system call and it returns the status and any return values.
- Details of the OS interface is hidden from the programmer by the API
- The caller need not know about the implementation of the System Call
- Only needs to obey the API and understand what OS will do as a result of the call.

#### System Call Parameter Passing

If more info is needed to be passed while making a system call, we can use parameter passing.

Three Methods of Parameter Passing:
- **Registers**: Some processor architectures allow system call parameters to be passed via specific registers. 
- **Stack**: Using stack. Parameters are pushed into stack in particular order for system call and the kernel receives the memory location of the start of parameter list of the stack. After utilizing, OS can pop it.
- **Memory Based**: For larger and complex data structure to be passed as parameters, we can pass their address. Kernel access that part of the memory directly. 

It can also be passed via table. Where the address of table is given and the OS goes and finds the parameters there.


#### Types of System Calls
(IMP)
Just put a () in font of the names and explain something about each process. 
##### Process Control:
- Create, terminate process
- End, abort
- Load, execute
- Get, set process attributes
- Wait for time, event 
- Allocate, free memory
- Debug
- Locks for managing access to shared data 

##### File Management 
- Create, delete file
- Open, close file
- Read, write, reposition file
- Get, set file attributes

##### Device Management
- Request, release device
- read, write, reposition
- get, set device attributes
- attach, detach files

##### Protection
- Control access to resources
- Get, set permissions
- Allow, deny user access

### System Services

System services provide a convenient environment for program development and execution. 

- File Management:
	Create, copy, delete, rename, print, dump, list and generally manipulate files and directories. 
- Status Information
	- Some may ask for info like date, time, memory available etc. 
	- Others provide detailed performance
	- Data is either printed or stored in the registry. 
- File Modification
	- Text editors for modifying files
	- Commands to search contents of file or perform transformations of the text.
- Programming Language Support
	- Compilers and assemblers with inbuilt debuggers.
- Program loading and execution
	- Loaders and linkers, debugging machine language
- Communications
	- Virtual connections among processes and computer systems. Remote login, send messages, mail, file transfer etc.
- Background Services
	- Launch boot
		- Some for system startup then terminate
		- Some for system boot to shutdown.
	- Disk checking and process scheduling, error logging
	- aka subsystems and daemons
- Application Programs
	- Run by users
	- Not part of OS
	- Launched via command line or point and click devices.
