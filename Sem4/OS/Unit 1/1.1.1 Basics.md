> Fig. Components connected with a Memory via bus

* Multiple CPUs, device controllers are connect via common bus(single/multiple) to access shared memory(RAM).
* Each device controller is in charge of a specific type of device. (Device Controller - bridge between CPU and I/O devices).
* CPU and controllers work simultaneously. 
* CPU and controllers compete for memory, therefore memory controller is need to sync access to memory.

## Important Terms

1. **Bootstrap program**: The initial program that runs when sys is powered up. 
	Stored in ROM.
	Locates OS Kernel(00000) and loads into memory.

2. **Interrupt**: Occurrence of event is signaled by an interrupt. Hardware can trigger a interrupt.
	<u>Functions of interrupt</u>:
	- Transfers control to interrupt service routine.
	- Interrupt architect saves address of interrupted instruction.
	- On completion CPU resumes the interrupted computaion.

3. **System Calls(Monitor Call)**: Software triggered interrupt due to execption. aka. System Call

# Storage Structure
(Self Explanatory)

> Fig. Storage Structure

- Cost ^ as access time ^.
-  Volatile when content gets lost when power is removed.

# I/O Structure

Reliability of device depends on I/O of the device.

Device Controller is in charge of 
- Local Buffer Storage
- Set of special purpose registers 

Each Device Controller has a device driver(Software that understands the device controller.).


## Working of I/O operations

> Fig. Working of I/O operations. 

- Diver loads registers within device controller. 
- Controller examines the contents of registers and determines the action to take.
- The controller starts the transfer of data into local buffer. Once transfer is complete an interrupt informs the device driver that the operation is done.
- Device driver returns control to the operation.

When this system is used for bulk data movement, a high overhead(CPU usage high) is produced. To solve the issue, DMA(Direct Memory Access) is used.

DMA Facts:
1) Device controller transfers blocks of data from the buffer storage into main memory without CPU intervention.
2) One interrupt is generated per block instead of one interrupt per byte.
