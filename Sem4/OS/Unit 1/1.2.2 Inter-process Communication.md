Process within a system may be independent or Cooperating.

Cooperating processes can be affected by other processes by the means of data sharing. 

Why to cooperate?
- Computational speedup
- Modularity
- Convenience 
- Information Sharing

Two cooperating processes need **Interprocess Communication**
IPC has two types:
- Shared Memory 
- Message Passing

## IPC Shared Memory Systems

Shared memory is a way for processes to communicate via a region of shared memory. 

One process creates the shared memory segment in its own memory space. Other processes that want to communicate with it can attach this shared memory segment to their memory space. Then, these processes can read from and write to the shared memory region to exchange information.

### Producer consumer problem

Method of cooperating processes:
- There lies a producer and a consumer. Producer produces info which is consumed by the consumer process. Buffer(Shared Memory) is used for communication between producer and consumer. Producer places information in buffer and consumer retrieves it from there.

Types of Buffer:
- Unbounded Buffer: 
	Producer can produce information and place it in the buffer without waiting. If empty the consumer will have to wait.
- Bounded Buffer:
	Fixed size. If buffer is full, producer has to wait. If its empty consumer has to wait. 

One issue is that data inconsistency and conflicts can occur if multiple process access the shared buffer at the same time.


## IPC Message Passing 

Message passing involves two main operations. Sending a message and receiving a message. 
Messages can be:
- Fixed size: Easier implementation but can make programming harder to work with.
- Variable sized messages: Complicated implementation but makes programming easier.

A link between processes must exist for communication to take place.
- Physical Link:
	- Shared Memory
	- Hardware Bus
	- Network
- Logical 
	- Direct/ Indirect
	- Synchronous/ Asynchronous
	- Buffering


### Direct/ Indirect
Process can communicate directly with each other, where the sender specifies the recipient. Link is established automatically. Only one pair is involved with only one link, link is usually bidirectional. 
Ex: `send(p, message)` and `recieve(q, message)`

Indirectly through a common channel. i.e. a port is created, messages are sent and received via that port. Post usage it is deleted.  
Ex: `send(A, message)` and `recieve(A, message)`, where A is the mailbox.
If port is shared with multiple process, its generally advisable for only one process to use receive at a time. 


### Synchronous/ Asynchronous
Message passing can be blocking/ non blocking.
- Blocking is considered synchronous:
	Here sender is blocked till message is received. The receiver is blocked till a message is available.
- Non blocking is considered Asynchronous:
	Sender continuously sends the message. The receiver receives a valid message or a null message.   


### Buffering
Queue of messages are attached to the link. 
Implemented in one of three ways:
- Zero Capacity: No messages are queued on a link. Sender must wait for receiver.
- Bounded Capacity: Finite length of n messages in queue of length n. Sender must wait if queue is full.
- Unbounded Capacity: Queue length Infinite length. Sender doesn't wait.

## Difference Between Shared Memory & Message Passing

|Message Passing| Shared Memory|
|---|---|
|Exchanges memory via the operating system.|Same portion of memory is shared between process|
|Suitable when small amounts of data are to be shared between shared systems|Good for large amount of data transfers between processes|
|Messages are sent by invoking send and receive operations. |If it is shared it gets immediately visible to sharing processes. |
|OS handles routing.|Synchronization is needed to coordinate access and to avoid race conditions.|

## Pipes 

Acts as a conduit allowing two processes to communicate

### Ordinary pipes 
Cannot be accessed  from outside the process that created it. Typically, a parent process creates a pipe and uses it to communicate with a child process that it created.
Ordinary Pipes allow communication in standard producer-consumer style
Producer writes to one end (the write-end of the pipe)
Consumer reads from the other end (the read-end of the pipe)
Ordinary pipes are therefore unidirectional

### Named pipes 
Can be accessed without a parent-child relationship. Named Pipes are more powerful than ordinary pipes
Communication is bidirectional
No parent-child relationship is necessary between the communicating processes
Several processes can use the named pipe for communication
Provided on both UNIX and Windows systems


## Communication in Client Server Systems

### Sockets
A socket is defined as an endpoint for communication
Concatenation of IP address and port – a number included at start of message packet to differentiate network services on a host
The socket 161.25.19.8:1625 refers to port 1625 on host 161.25.19.8
Communication consists between a pair of sockets
All ports below 1024 are well known, used for standard services
Special IP address 127.0.0.1 (loopback) to refer to system on which process is running

### Remote Procedure Calls
Remote procedure call (RPC) abstracts procedure calls between processes on networked systems
•Again uses ports for service differentiation
Stubs – client-side proxy for the actual procedure on the server
The client-side stub locates the server and marshals the parameters
The server-side stub receives this message, unpacks the marshalled parameters, and performs the procedure on the server
Data representation handled via External Data Representation (XDL) format to account for different architectures
•Big-endian and little-endian
Remote communication has more failure scenarios than local
•Messages can be delivered exactly once rather than at most once
OS typically provides a rendezvous (or matchmaker) service to connect client and server
