Its aim is to maximize CPU use and to quickly switch processes onto CPU core. 
It maintains scheduling queues of processes.
- **Ready Queue:** Set of process residing in main memory ready to be executed next.
- **Wait Queue:** Set of processes waiting for an event.

## Context Switches

When CPU switches to another process the system must save the state of the old process and load the save state for the new process via a context switch. The state of the old process gets saved in the PCB. 
When the process has to resume execution it has to be restored.
Switching is pure overhead, no useful work is done while switching. 
Depending upon the hardware the context switch can be fast or slow. Due to its heavy hardware dependency, if multiple registers exist then context switch is faster. 
If the OS is complex more work will be required for switching.

## Operation on processes

### Process Creation
Parent process create child process which create other sub processes, this forms a tree of processes. Each process is identified uniquely by a process ID.

#### Resource Sharing:
When it comes to resource sharing between parent and child we have three options:
- Parent and Children share all resources.
- Child share a subset of parent's resources.
- Parent and child share no resources.

#### Execution Options
- Parent and child execute Concurrently 
- Parent waits for the child to terminate. 

#### Address Space
- Child is duplicate of parent.
- Child has a program loaded into it. 
  
In Windows, the command used to create a process is `CreateProcess`. In Linux, the command used to create a process is `fork`.

### Process Termination

A process terminate when it finishes executing. It tells the OS to delete it by using `exit()` system call, OS does so while releasing files from the memory. 
If child is done executing it returns status value to parent.  

If there is a crunch in resources, a parent can terminate the child process. Or if the task assigned to the child is no longer needed. Or if the parent itself is exiting. 

If in the case parent process terminates the children processes must also terminate. This is called cascading termination which is done by the OS.

The parent can use `wait()` for the termination of child process. This returns the status info and pid of terminated process. 

If no parent is waiting then process is a zombie
If parent gets terminated before the child and without using `wait()`, the child process gets called a orphan.

###  Examples:

#### Android Process Hierarchy 
Mobile operating systems often have to terminate processes to reclaim system resources such as memory. From most to least important:
- Foreground process
- Visible process
- Service process
- Background process
- Empty process

Android will begin terminating processes that are least important.

#### Multi-process Architecture a in Modern Browsers
Browsers these days have three or more process running at once.
- Browser process
- Renderer for HTML, CSS and JS
- Plug ins
- Extension manager etc.
