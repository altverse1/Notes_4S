Modern applications are multi threaded. 
Threads run within applications. 

Multiple threads allow one program to do multiple this like:
- Update display. 
- Spell check
- Fetch Data
- Write to file

Process creation is heavy, while thread creating is light weight. Can simply code and increase efficiency. Kernel are generally multithreaded. 

When threads are created, they require resources such as stack space, a program counter, registers, a unique identifier (thread ID), and access to shared resources. These resources are provided by the operating system and used by threads to execute code and interact with other threads within a process

Advantages of Multithreading:
- Responsiveness- Allows application to remain responsive to user while performing time consuming tasks. 
- Resource Sharing- Threads share memory and resources of the processes by default. That is multiple threads can work on the same data and manipulate it at the same time.  
- Economy- Creating and switching threads is more efficient in terms of memory and time consumption. Threads share same resources, memory hence creating lesser overhead.  
- Scalability- Threads can run in parallel on different processing cores. Meaning multithreading takes advantage of multi core processors. Hence improved performance and improving scalability in comparison to single threaded processors.


## Multicore Programming: 

Multithreaded programming is a way to effectively utilize multiple cores in a CPU and to improve concurrency. 
In single core systems, as the core can handle only one thread at a time, execution will occur in a interleaved manner. 
In multi core systems, concurrency can also mean that threads can run in parallel as each core can handle separate threads simultaneously.  

Main difference between concurrency and parallelism:
- Concurrency refers to multiple tasks making progress. 
- Parallelism means performing multiple tasks simultaneously.

### Challenges to Multicore Programming:
Its a challenge for programmers to convert existing applications to take advantage of multi threaded systems. 

The challenges arise due to:
- Identifying Tasks, finding parts of the program that can run independently or diff core.
- Balance: Ensuring equal workload distribution among tasks.
- Data Splitting: Dividing data to be processed by different cores. 
- Data Dependency: Managing sync between tasks that rely on shared data.
- Testing and debugging: Dealing with complexities of testing concurrent progs. 


### Types of Parallelism 

1) **Data Parallelism**: Focuses on distributing subsets of the same data across multiple computing cores and performing same operation on each core.
2) **Task Parallelism**: Distributing tasks across multiple cores. Each thread does a unique operation. Different threads may be operating on the same data or on different data.

### Amdahl's Law: 
Identifies performance gain from adding additional cores to an application to an application that has both serial and parallel components.

$$
speedup \leq \frac{1}{S+{\frac{1-S}{N}}}
$$
Here S is for serial portions and N is processing cores. 
That is, if application is 75% parallel / 25% serial, moving from 1 to 2 cores results in speedup of 1.6 times

### User Threads & Kernel Threads

User threads: Management done by user level thread library. 
3 primary thread library: 
- POSIX Pthreads
- Windows
- Java Threads

Kernel Threads: Supported by the kernel. Virtually all general purpose OS like windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS etc.

## Multithreading Models

Different models establish relation between user threads and kernel threads

### Many-to-One Model
- Multiple user level threads to single kernel thread
- Thread management is efficient but lacks parallel execution on multicore systems.
- Blocking system calls can cause entire process to block.
- Not widely used.

### One-to-One Model
- Each user thread is mapped to a separate kernel thread. 
- Provides more concurrency and supports parallel execution on multicore systems.
- Creating a user thread requires creating a corresponding kernel thread which may impact performance, hence impacting performance. 
- Implemented in Linux & Windows operating systems. 

### Many-to-Many Model
- Multiplexes multiple user level thread to to a smaller or equal number of kernel threads. 
- Allows for parallel execution on multicore processors.

Variation is **Two-Level Model**
Allows user thread to be bound to a single kernel thread, while having multiple user level thread to smaller or equal number of kernel threads.
