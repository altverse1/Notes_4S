Process can executed concurrently. Any interruption at any time can result in a partially completed execution. This may result in a inconsistency in the shared data. Hence it becomes necessary to put in place mechanisms that ensure orderly execution is done.


## Critical Section Problem

It's a segment of code of a process that involves change of shared data, updating table or writing file. When a process is in a critical section no other may be in its critical section, this is to ensure proper sync and conflict avoidance. 

Solution to this problem must meet three requirements:

1) Mutual Exclusion: Only one process can be in its critical section at a time. Others must wait till it finishes. 
2) Progress: If no process is in critical section and multiple want to enter. It must be so that all that want to enter critical section should get a chance to do so. 
3) Bounded Waiting: A limit on number of times process can enter critical section after it has requested to enter its critical section. 

### Critical Section Handling in OS

Race condition can occur when multiple processes access shared memory simultaneously without sync. 

Handling critical sections in OS we use two approaches:

- Preemptive Kernel: Allows for preemption of process when running in kernel mode. Needs careful consideration to prevent race condition. 
- Non Preemptive Kernel: Runs until kernel mode, block or process voluntarily yields CPU, this method will lead to less responsiveness.


## Peterson's Solution

Its an algorithm for solving critical section problem.  
It uses two shared variables, i.e. turn and flag. The Peterson's solution aims to use these variables to coordinate the entry of process into their critical sections. 

The turn variable indicates whose turn it is to enter the critical section.
Flag indicates if a process is ready to enter critical section.

We can prove the three conditions we saw earlier get met by Peterson's Solution.
1) Mutual exclusion is preserved as process Pi enters CS only if flag(j) is false or turn is i. 
2) Progress requirement is satisfied. 
3) Bounded waiting is met. 

2 and 3 are met as process sets flag(j) = false or sets turn = i before exiting, allowing other processes to get into their CS.

## Semaphore

A sync tool that provides more sophisticate way for process to sync their activities.
A semaphore S is a integer variable that is accessed only through two standard operations 
- wait() - Checks if Semaphore value is greater than 0 then decrements if it is. Else waits.
- signal() - Simply increment the semaphore value. 

There are two main types of semaphore:
1) **Counting Semaphores**: These are integer value semaphores and have an unrestricted value domain. These are used to coordinate resource access. When resources are added semaphore value increases and decreases if otherwise.
2) **Binary Semaphores**: Value for these are restricted to 0 and 1. Wait operation only works when the semaphore value is 1 and the signal operation succeeds when value is 0. These are usually easier to implement. 


## Monitor
As Semaphores can lead to timing error(Due to incorrect sequence of wait() and signal()) we using monitors. They encapsulate data and operations within a single structure ensuring that only one process can be active within a monitor at a time. 

### Conditional Variables
It is a sign that suggest that a process is waiting for its turn to enter the monitor. 
Condition variables, like `x` and `y`, are associated with specific conditions and can be manipulated using `wait()` and `signal()` operations.
![[os_monitor.png]]
When a process performs `x.wait()`, it's telling the monitor, "Hey, I'm waiting for this specific condition `x` to be fulfilled." This process will then be temporarily suspended by the monitor until another process performs a `x.signal()`, indicating that the condition `x` has been met and the waiting process can continue.
