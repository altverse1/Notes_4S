Auto extraction of info from images. Info can be text, position, object detection and recognition.

## PIL

Aka. Python Imaging Library
Provides:
- Resizing
- Cropping
- Rotating
- Color Inversion, etc.

To 'Read'/open images we do:

```python
from PIL import Image
pil_im = Image.open('snek.jpg')
```

The return value is a PIL object.

We can invert color by doing:
```python
pil_im = Image.open('snek.jpg').convert('L')
```
The above converts the color to Gray Scale.


### Convert to Other Formats

```python
from PIL import Image
import os
for infile in filelist:
	outfile = os.path.splitext(infile)[0] + ".jpg"
	try Image.open(infile).save(outfile)
	except IOerror: print("cannot convert", infile)
```
Opens PIL image object. The `save()` method saves the image to a file with the given filename. 
It then tries to open it if errors are given.


### Other Features

#### Thumbnail
`thumbnail()` - Method takes new size and converts the image to a thumbnail of the specified size.
```python
pil_im.thumbnail((128,128))
```

#### Copy Paste Regions
It's cropping. Done be giving a 4-tuple (a box) with the 4 values being coordinates of left, right, upper and lower.
![[_excalidraw_/aml_s4.excalidraw.md#^group=cNn4eEQdS_TjSqDBUVzX8|200x200]]
```python
box = (100, 100, 400, 400)
region = pil_im.crop(box)
```

Upper left corner of any image is given (0,0). 
We can paste the region in a different way later then.

```python
region = region.transpose(Image.ROTATE_180)
pil_im.paste(region,box)
```

#### Resize and Rotate
To resize we simply use `resize()`.
```python
out = pil_im.resize((128,128))
```
To Rotate an image we use `rotate()`
```python
out = pil_im.rotate(45)
```


## Matplotlib

Used for plotting images, points and lines. But can be used for CV.

Used in CV for:
- Interest points.
- Correspondences. 
- Object detection using points and lines. 

```python
from PIL import Image
from pylab import *

im = array(Image.open('empier.jpg'))
impshow(im)                  ##plots image

x = [100,100,400,400]        
y = [100,500,200,500]

plot(x,y, 'r*')              ##plots the points with red star symbol
plot(x[:2], y[:2])           ##draws line btw first two point and list

title('Plotting: empire.jpg')
show()                       ##show() displays the window 
```


## Interactive Annotation

This is the basis for those applications where user input has to be given to the image which can be for training purpose etc.

Function used for this is: `ginput()`

Ex:
```python
from PIL import Image
from pylab import *

im = array(Image.open('empire.jpg'))
imshow(im)

print("Click 3 points.")
x = ginput(3)                  ##Saves coordinatees of 3 points in list

print("You clicked: ",x)
show()
```


## NumPy Array Image Representation

NumPy can be used to represent images too.
Mainly for their efficiency and compatibility in ML applications.

### Greyscale images

- Single Color channel. Which is the brightness of each pixel.
- 2D arrays are used to represent them, each element in array represents pixel intensity.
- Shape of array is (mxn).

```python
import numpy as np

image_grey = np.array([[127,132,232],[123,43,23],[123,54,342]], dtype = np.uint8)
print(image_grey)
print('Shape: ', image_grey.shape)
```

### RGB

- Consist of 3 channel Red, Green, Blue.
- 3D array representation . 
- SHAPE IS (height, width and channel). The channel consists of R G & B.

``` python
import numpy as np

img_rgb = np.array([
			[[250,0,0],[0,255,0],[0,0,255]],
			[[250,255,0],[255,0,255],[0,255,255]],
			[[250,255,255],[0,0,0],[126,128,128]],
])

print(img_rgb)
print('Shape: images_gb')
```

RGBA

Basically RGB with transparency levels .
3D arrays are used, but with an additional channel for transperancy.

Ex: Shape is: (Heights, width, channel) and channel consists of (R,G,B,A)

Ex: 
```python
import numpy as np

img_rgb = np.array([
			[[250,0,0,155],[0,255,0,127],[0,0,255,0]],
			[[250,255,0,255],[255,0,255,,127],[0,255,255,0]],
			[[250,255,255],[0,0,0,127],[126,128,128,0]],
])

print(img_rgb)
print('Shape: images_gb')
```
