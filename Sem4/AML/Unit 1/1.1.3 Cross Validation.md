Used for evaluating a model's performance. Involves dividing the dataset into subsets aka. folds. 
We train the model on one of the `folds` and use the rest for validation.

The results are averaged and the model's evaluation is done.

- Dataset is spit into k folds k = 5 or 10
- For each fold i, train model on all other folds except i.
- Eval the model on remaining fold i.
- Repeat the above steps for all k folds.
- Calc avg performance eval across k eval. To get model's performance. 

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

iris = load_iris()
x = iris.data
y = iris.target

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

scores = cross_val_scores(clf, x, y, cv = 5)
mean_accuracy = scores.mean()

print("Mean Accuracy: ",mean_accuracy)
```

Here the function returns an array of scores for each fold, which is then avg. to get mean accuracy.
