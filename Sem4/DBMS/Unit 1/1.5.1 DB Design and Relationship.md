This is the general process of designing most of the databases. 

### Design of Company Database

|*Department*|Name|Number|Locations|Manager|Manager_start_date|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|

|*Project*|Name|Number|Location|Controlling_department|
|--|--|--|--|--|

|*Employee*|Name|SSN|Sex|Address|Salary|Birth_Date|Department|Supervisor|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|

|*Dependant*|Employee|Dependant_name|Sex|Birth_date|Relationship|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|

### Weak Entity Types

Entity Types that do not have key attributes of their own. They are identified by relating with another entity type which is known as a owner entity type. In the above database the Entity Type DEPENDENT is a weak entity. As it relies on a owner entity type which is EMPLOYEE. 
A partial key is used to uniquely identify the weak entity. Here if no two dependents of the employee are same, dependent name is the partial key.


## Relationship type, Relationship Set, Role & Structural Constraints

Relationship is an association between two or more entities. 

### Degree of Relationship 

1) Unary (Degree 1)
	Exists when there is association with only one entity. Ex: Employee `Manages` Employee. 
2) Binary (Degree 2)
	Exists when there is association among two entities. Ex: Publisher `Publishes` Book.
3) Ternary (Degree 3)
	Exists when there is an association among three entities.


### Relationship Constraints

1) **Cardinality Ratio**:
	Maximum number of relationship instances that an entity can participate in. 
	Possible Cardinality Ratios for binary relationship:  1:1, 1:N, N:1, M:N. 
	Ex: 
	1 Employee $Manages$ 1 Department
	N Employee $Works For$ 1 Department
	M Student $Studies$ N Subject

2) **Participation Constraints**: 
	Specifies whether existence of an entity depends on it being related to another entity.
	Types of participation constraints: 
	- Total
	- Partial

	> Participation Constraints
	
	Here each department has one manager. But not all employees are managers.


### Attributes of Relationship Types

Attributes of 1:1 or 1:N relationships types can be migrated to one of the participation entity types. 
- In 1:1 relationship type, attributes can be migrated to either of the entity types.
	Start date can be migrated to employee or department.
- In 1:N relationship type, attributes are migrated only to the entity type on the N side of the relationship.
	The attribute attr has to be migrated to R
- In M:N relationship type, some attributes can be determined by a combination of participating entities. 
	The attribute hours is determined by both employee and project.

#### Role Names & Recursive Relationship

Role Name Signifies the role that a participating entity plays in each relationship. This is useful in Recursive Relationships

**Recursive Relationships**: Same entity type participates more than once in a relationship type in different roles. 

Ex:  Employee plays the role of a supervisor and a supervisee.

## Alternative Notations of ER diagrams

Associates pair of integer numbers (min, max) with each participation of an entity in a relationship type, where 0$\le$ min $\le$ max and max$\ge$ 1.

![[dbms_alter.png]]

Ex: Minmax notation (0,1) says a employee can manage at the most 1 department & (1,1) says a department can have at most 1 manager.
In (1,1) every employee works for 1 department and (1,N) says all the departments have 1 or more employee.
