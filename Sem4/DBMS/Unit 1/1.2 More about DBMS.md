
## Database Models

Set of concepts to describe the structure(data types, relationships and constraints applied to the data) of database. 

This is done to achieve data abstraction(separation of conceptual data from it's physical storage details. )

### Categories of data models: 
1) **Conceptual/High level/Entity based/Object Based Data Models**:
	Provides concepts that are close to the way many users perceive data.
	- Uses entities(represents a real world object), attributes(a interesting property of entity) and relationships(association between entities) 
	- Examples: Entities like employee and projects. Attributes like name, emp_no of the employee. Relationships like employee `works on` project.

2) **Physical/low-level/internal Data Models**:
	Provides concepts of how data is stored as files in the computer. By representing record formats, orderings, access paths(for efficient searching, ex index, keyword etc.). 

3) **Implementation/Representational Data Models:**
	Balances user views with some computer storage details. Used freq. in DBMSs as relational models. Use hierarchical and network models for data storage.


## Schemas, Instances and Database State

### Schema(Intension)
Description of the database is called the database schema, specified during design and does not change frequently. 

**Schema Diagram** is a database schema that is displayed diagrammatically. Objects within the schema are called **schema constructs**. Ex: STUDENT, COURSE.

**Snapshot/Database state**(Extension) is the data present in the database at a particular state.
When database schema is defined to the database, there is no snapshot, the first snapshot arrives when we insert the first data.

When new data items get added(Not so frequently) to the schema it is called **Schema Evolution**.
