Important characteristics of database approach are:
1) Use of a catalog to store schema to make it self describing.
2) Insulating programs and data.
3) Support of multiple user views.

To achieve the characteristics we use three schema architecture.
It's goal is, to separate user application from the physical database.

Three levels: 
1) Internal
	Describes physical structure of database. Describes how data is stored and accessed.
2) Conceptual
	Describes structure of the database. Hides physical storage details and shows entities, data types, constraints and relationships.
3) External
	Has number of external views. Describes a part of database that a user is interested in and hides rest of the database.

A request made by user is passed through external, conceptual and finally internal levels from where it is then fetched from stored database.

The process is transforming request and results between levels is done via mapping. 

## Data Independence

Capacity to change the schema at one level of database system without having to change the schema at the next higher level. Only the mapping between the two levels is changed. Hence preventing the applications accessing the data to remain unchanged.

Types
1) Logical Data Independence 
	Ability to modify conceptual schema without changing the external schemas or application programs.
2) Physical Data Independence
	Ability to modify the internal schema without changing the conceptual schema. 
	- These changes might be needed to improve performance. Changing access path to improve performance.
