## Sample Database

The **COMPANY database** keeps track of a company’s employees, departments, and projects.
- The company is organized into departments. Each department has a unique name, a unique number, and a particular employee who manages the department. We keep track of the start date when that employee began managing the department. A department may have several locations. 
- A department controls a number of projects, each of which has a unique name, a unique number, and a single location. 
- We store each employee’s name, Social Security number, address, salary, sex (gender), and birth date. An employee is assigned to one department, but may work on several projects, which are not necessarily controlled by the same department. We keep track of the current number of hours per week that an employee works on each project. We also keep track of the direct supervisor of each employee (who is another employee). 
- We want to keep track of the dependents of each employee for insurance purposes. We keep each dependent’s first name, sex, birth date, and relationship to the employee.

## Entity Types, sets, attributes and keys

Entity is a object that has a real world existence. 
ex: EMPLOYEE

The attributes of an entity are features that describe it. Like for EMPLOYEE it is name, dob, SSN, sex etc. 

Types of attributes:

1) **Composite vs Simple(atomic) attributes**

|Composite|Simple|
|--|--|
|Can be divided into further parts, can form hierarchy |Cannot be divided further|
|Ex: Name -> First Name, Middle Name and Last Name|Ex: Weight|


2) **Single valued vs Multi valued attribute**

|Single Valued|Multi Valued|
|---|---|
|Have single value for a particular entity|Can have a set of values for a particular entity|
|Ex: Age -> Single Valued attribute of a person|Ex: College Degree, Languages Known etc.|


3) **Stored vs Derived Attributes**

|Derived|Stored|
|---|---|
|Can be derived from other attributes|Attributes that can be used for bringing derived attributes into existence|
|Ex: Age -> Can be derived from DOB|Ex: DOB|


 **Term: Null Values**
	Null is something which is not applicable or unknown.
	Can also be used when we do not know the value of attribute.
	For example in EMPLOYEE table the address of a certain employee may be unknown
	 
|Name|SSN|Address|Phone No.|
|---|---|---|---|
|Joshua|003|NULL|123456789|

### More Terminologies

- **Entity Types:** A collection of entities that have the same attributes. Ex: Employees with the same set of attributes. In the example below, Joshua and Bill are entities and they share the same attribute say address. 

|Name|SSN|Address|Phone No.|
|---|---|---|---|
|Joshua|003|Street A|123456789|
|Bill|0021|Street C|123321534|

- **Entity Set:** A collection of entities of a particular entity type at a point in time.  
- **Key Attribute**: That attribute that is capable of identifying each entity uniquely. Ex: In EMPLOYEE the key attribute is SSN
- **Value Set**: Set of values that can be assigned to an attribute.
