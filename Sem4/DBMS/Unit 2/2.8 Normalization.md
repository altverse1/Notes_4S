## Functional Dependency

Functional dependency, denoted as X->Y between two sets of attributes X and Y in a relation schema R specifies that for any two tuples with matching X values, their corresponding Y values must also match. 

This says that Y is functionally dependent on X.

This however doesn't mean Y->X.

Examples:
- SSN -> Ename
- Pnumber -> {Pname, Plocation}
- {SSN, Pnumber} -> Hours


## Normal Forms

Set of certain conditions are used for the normalization process of a relational schema design.

**Def.**: The normal form of a relation refers to the highest normal form condition that the relation satisfies. This indicates the degree to which it has been normalized.


### Key and Attribute

**Superkey:** is a set of attributes of relational schema R that uniquely identifies each tuple within a legal relation state. 

**Key** is a Superkey with the with the property that, removal of any attribute from it will result in a set of attributes that no longer get unique identification.

**Candidate Key:** Key that can become the primary key.

Attribute of relational schema is termed as a **prime attribute** if it is a part of candidate keys.


### 1NF

Disallows multivalued attribute, composite attributes and their combo. 

> [!info] Def.
> Domain of an attribute must include only atomic values and that the value of any attribute in a tuple must be a single value from the domain of attribute.

**Examples:** 
![[_excalidraw_/dbms_norm.excalidraw.md#^group=7ZHbNhWtXTll_pzgV5iPt]]

#### Ways to achieve the form:
For the above example.
1) Make a separate relation called location and set the primary key of this relation as {Dnumber(yeah its the fk), Dlocation}.
2) Expand the key so that separate tuples can hold different values of Dlocation in the same table and set the primary keys to be {Dnumber, Dlocatio}. This can cause redundancy tho.
3) If there are few locations only then we can have atomic attributes(like one hot encoder in aml lol.) and can use NULL values to represent absence of department in that location. The introduction to null values can be a problem tho.


### 2NF
Concept of full functional dependency is the base  here.

Full functional dependency for X->Y is when removal of any attribute from X results in the dependency not holding true anymore. 

Partial Dependency is when despite the removal of an attribute A in X the functional dependency holds. 

> [!info] Def.
> A relation schema is in 2NF if every non prime attribute A in R is fully functionally dependent on the primary key of R

Here {ssn, pnumber} -> Hours is a Full functional dependency.
Whereas {ssn, pnumber} -> Ename is a partial dependency.
This is because despite the removal of pnumber {ssn} -> Ename holds true.

To normalize a relation to 2NF we can break it down into smaller relationships to ensure full functional dependency.


### 3NF

Based on the concept of transitive dependency. 

Transitive dependency is when there exists a set of attributes Z in R such that they are neither the candidate key nor a subset of any key of R and both X->Z and Z->Y hold.

> [!info] Def.
> A relation schema is in 3NF if it satisfies 2NF and no non prime attribute of it is transitively dependent on the primary key. 

![[dbms3nf.png]]
The dependency SSN -> Dmgr_ssn is transitive through Dnumber.

Here the upper relation is not in 3NF due to the transitive dependency of Dmgr_ssn on SSN via dnumber. 

To resolve this the simplest approach is to break it down into separate relations.

While querying a simple natural join will result in the original emp_dept without any spurious tuples. 


## General Definitions

**Second Normal Form (2NF)** ensures that every attribute in a relation is fully dependent on the entire primary key, considering all candidate keys as well. It prevents partial dependencies where an attribute depends on only a part of the primary key. If the primary key consists of a single attribute, 2NF is automatically satisfied.

**Third Normal Form (3NF)** ensures that there are no transitive dependencies between non-key attributes and the primary key. It means that every non-key attribute should depend only on the primary key, not on any other non-key attributes. If a non-trivial dependency exists between a non-key attribute and the primary key, either the attribute should be part of the primary key or it should be a prime attribute, which means it is part of a candidate key. This prevents unnecessary redundancy and anomalies in the database.
