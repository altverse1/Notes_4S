General Structure of a Retrieval Query:
```sql
SELECT <attribute and function list> 
FROM <table list> 
[ WHERE <condition> ] 
[ GROUP BY <grouping attribute(s)> ] 
[ HAVING <group condition> ] 
[ ORDER BY <attribute list> ] ; 

-- [] = optional
```

The logical query processing order in SQL can be summarized as follows:

1. FROM: Specify the tables or views involved and perform joins.
2. WHERE: Filter the rows based on specified conditions.
3. GROUP BY: Group the remaining rows into sets based on grouping expressions.
4. HAVING: Filter the groups based on specified conditions.
5. SELECT: Retrieve the desired columns or expressions from the grouped and filtered rows.
6. ORDER BY: Sort the result set based on specified criteria.

> In case of nested queries, the nested one gets executed first.
 

SQL can have tuples with exactly same attributes, this is not similar to the relational model we have been seeing till now.

## Select From Where

```sql
select <attribute list>
from <table_list>
where <condition>;
```


> [!question]
> Retrieve The Birth Date and address of employee whose name is 'John B Smith'
> >[!answer]-
> >```sql
> >SELECT Bdate, Address
> >FROM Employee
> >WHERE fname = 'John' AND Minit = 'B' AND lname = 'Smith'; 
> >```

The `WHERE` clause specifies the Boolean condition that must be true for any retrieved tuple. This is the selection condition.
SQL goes through all tuples in a selected relation and checks if the conditions specified in the `WHERE` clause are true and then selects the tuples.


> [!question]
> Retrieve the name and address of all employees who work for the ‘Research’ Department
> >[!answer]-
> >```sql
> >SELECT Fname , Lname , Address 
> >FROM EMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT 
> >WHERE Dname =‘Research’ AND Dnumber = Dno;
> >```

Dnumber = Dno is the join condition as it joins two relations Dno of EMPLOYEE and Dnumber of DEPARTMENT.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">A query that involves only selection and join conditions plus projection attributes is known as a </mark> **select-project-join query**.



> [!question]
> For every project located in ‘Stafford’, list the project number, the controlling department number, and the department manager’s last name, address, and birth date
> >[!answer]-
> >```sql
> >SELECT Pnumber, Dnum, Lname, Address, Bdate 
> >FROM PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE 
> >WHERE Dnum = Dnumber AND Mgr_ssn = Ssn AND Plocation =‘Stafford’;
> >```

Two join conditions are involved 
- Join between Project and Department via Dnum = Dnumber 
- Join between Employee and Department by Mgr_SSN = SSN


### Using an Alias

Attributes having similar names in different relation can cause ambiguity in retrieval. To avoid said ambiguity we use an alias. This is done by 

We can do like so: (Select employees only from the 'Research' department.)
```sql
SELECT e.Fname, e.LName, e.Address 
FROM EMPLOYEE e , DEPARTMENT d
WHERE d.DName =‘Research’ AND d.Dnumber = e.Dno ;
```


Referring the same query: 
> [!question]
> For each employee, retrieve the employee’s first and last name and the first and last name of his or her immediate supervisor.
> >[!answer]-
> >```sql
> >SELECT E.Fname, E.Lname, S.Fname, S.Lname 
> >FROM EMPLOYEE AS E , EMPLOYEE AS S 
> >WHERE E.Super_ssn = S.Ssn ;
> >```

We can also create alias for attributes by doing `EMPLOYEE AS E ( Fn , Mi , Ln , Ssn , Bd , Addr , Sex , Sal , Sssn , Dno )`


### Unspecified WHERE and Use of `*`

No where clause means no condition hence all tuples of relation in FROM are retrieved. 
Like in 
```sql
SELECT Ssn FROM EMPLOYEE ;
```
All SSNs are Retrieved from EMPLOYEE relation

In presence of more that one relation CROSS PRODUCT will happen. But ambiguity can be caused
```sql
SELECT Ssn , Dname FROM EMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT;
```

To retrieve all attributes we use `*` Which is 'all the attributes'
- `SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Dno =5;`
- `SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT WHERE Dname = ‘ Research ’ AND Dno = Dnumber ;`


### Tables as Sets in SQL

SQL treats tables as multisets allowing duplicates. Duplication is performance costly, hence it is not done and also we do set some constraints like **PK** etc. 
Key restrictions if specified force the table to behave like a set. 


|Operation|Description|
|---|---|
|DISTINCT|Eliminates duplicate tuples from the query result, producing a set of distinct tuples.|
|ALL|Retains all tuples, including duplicates, in the query result.|
|UNION|Combines tuples from two or more queries, eliminating duplicates from the result.|
|EXCEPT|Retrieves tuples from the first query that are not present in the second query.|
|INTERSECT|Retrieves tuples that are common to both the first and second queries.|
|UNION ALL|Combines tuples from two or more queries, including duplicates in the result.|
|EXCEPT ALL|Retrieves all tuples from the first query that are not present in the second query.|
|INTERSECT ALL|Retrieves all tuples that are common to both the first and second queries.|

Examples:

Distinct: 
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM EMPLOYEE ;
```

ALL:
```sql
SELECT ALL Salary FROM EMPLOYEE ;
```

Union
>[!Question] 
>Make a list of all project numbers for projects that involve an employee whose last name is ‘Smith’, either as a worker or as a manager of the department that controls the project.
> >[!answer]-
> >```sql
> >(SELECT DISTINCT Pnumber FROM PROJECT , DEPARTMENT , EMPLOYEE WHERE Dnum = Dnumber AND Mgr_ssn = Ssn AND Lname =‘Smith’ ) 
> >UNION
> >(SELECT DISTINCT Pnumber FROM PROJECT , WORKS_ON , EMPLOYEE WHERE Pnumber = Pno AND Essn = Ssn AND Lname =‘Smith’ );
> >```


### Pattern Matching & Arithmetic Operations

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|String pattern matching|Allows the use of the LIKE comparison operator with % and _ wildcards for partial string matching.|
|Arithmetic operations|Enables the use of standard arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /) for numeric values or attributes with numeric domains
|BETWEEN operator| Provides the ability to perform range comparisons using the BETWEEN operator.|
|Ordering query results|Allows the ordering of query results using the ORDER BY clause, with options for ascending and descending order.|

Examples: 

String Matching: 
```sql
-- To select for employees in Address Houston
SELECT Fname, Lname
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Address LIKE '%Houston, TX%';

--  To retrieve employees born in 1950's
SELECT Fname, Lname
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Bdate LIKE '195______';
```

Arithmetic Operations:
```sql
-- Giving employees who work in ProductX a 10% raise 
SELECT E.Fname , E.Lname , 1.1 * E.Salary AS Increased_sal 
FROM EMPLOYEE AS E , WORKS_ON AS W , PROJECT AS P 
WHERE E.Ssn = W.Essn AND W.Pno = P.Pnumber AND P.Pname =‘ProductX’;
```

Between : 
```sql
-- Retrieve all employees in dno 5, whose salary is between 30k and 40k
SELECT * 
FROM EMPLOYEE 
WHERE (Salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 40000 ) AND Dno = 5
```

Ordering:
```sql
--Retrieve a list of employees and the projects they are working on, ordered by department and, within each department, ordered alphabetically by last name, then first name
SELECT D.Dname, E.Lname, E.Fname, P.Pname 
FROM DEPARTMENT D, EMPLOYEE E, WORKS_ON W, PROJECT P 
WHERE D.Dnumber = E.Dno AND E.Ssn = W.Essn AND W.Pno = P.Pnumber ORDER BY D.Dname , E.Lname , E.Fname ;
```

Default is Ascending but we can also specify  ordering by: 
`ORDER BY D.Dname DESC, E.Lname ASC, E.Fname ASC`
