
## The 4 informal Guidelines

- Making sure that the semantics of the attributes is clear in the schema 
- Reducing the redundant information in tuples 
- Reducing the NULL values in tuples 
- Disallowing the possibility of generating spurious tuples


### Imparting Clear Semantics 

- Relation schemas should have clear real-world meanings associated with their attributes.
- The semantics of a relation refer to the meaning resulting from the interpretation of attribute values in a tuple.
- Clear semantics make it easier to explain and understand the meaning of attributes in a relation schema.

Relation Schema: EMPLOYEE

|Ename|SSN(PK)|Bdate|Address|Dno(FK)|          
|--|---|--|--|--|
Employee

|Dname|Dno(PK)|Dmgrssn(FK)|
|--|--|--|
Department

|Dno(FK,PK)|Dloc(PK)|
|--|--|
Dept_location

|Pname|pno(PK)|ploc|Dno(FK)|
|--|--|--|--|
Project

|ssn(FK,PK)|pno(FK,PK)|hrs|
|--|--|--|

The ease with which the relation's attributes can be explained is an informal approach.
The above schema can easily be explained as everything is pretty much clear form the relationships between the table to the attributes having real world meaning.

### Redundant Information in Tuples and Anomalies

Minimize storage while grouping. Anomalies can arise due to unnecessary joins. 

#### Anomalies

1) Insertion Anomalies: Can Exist in two ways:
	1) If there are not employees in a table called EMP_DEPT(ename, ssn, bdate, address, dno, dname, dmgr_ssn) then the only way to insert a value is by placing NULLs on dmgrssn.
	2) While inserting we must ensure that values related to a certain attribute are consistent among all tuples. Like for dno = 5 the dname must be 'economics' and not anything else.
2) Deletion Anomalies: Deletion of tuples in an table can cause related information to be lost and causes inconsistencies in the data.
3) Modification Anomalies: When values of attributes of a table are altered, inconsistencies an conflicts may arise within the table itself. Like updating the course name of a subject for one student but not others. Like Math101 to Mathematics101.

### NULLs in Tuples

If many attributes do not apply to all tuples, we get many NULLs. Storage space gets wasted. Can cause problems while joining, using aggregate operations like SUM, COUNT etc. Hence making almost everything unpredictable.

### Generation of Spurious Tuples

Say a schema has Emp(Name*, ProjLoc*) and Proj(SSN*, pnumber*, hours, pname, plocation)
If we try joining this with natural join, the attribute plocation will automatically be chosen. But plocation is not a primary key or a foriegn key in both tables. Hence extra-unnecessary tuples aka spurious tuples get generated.

These informal guidelines help evaluate the quality of relation schema design by promoting clear semantics, minimizing redundancy and NULL values, and ensuring the generation of accurate and valid tuples
