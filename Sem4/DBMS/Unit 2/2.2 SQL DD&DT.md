**Some conventions**
	Table = Relation
	Row = Tuple
	Column = Attribute

## Schema & Catalog

**Schema** - It's a concept that was incorporated in order to group together tables that belong to the same database application.
To create a schema we do `CREATE SCHEMA COMPANY AUTHORIZATION 'WillSmith';` It includes AUTH that allows us to to find out who the schema belongs to. Each schema can include tables, constraints, views etc.

**Catalog** - Its a named collection of schemas in SQL environment. Integrity constraints can be defined between relations if they exist in schemas within the same catalog.


## Creating Tables 

The `CREATE TABLE` command is used to create a new relation by specify the attributes with the initial constraints within it. We can also specify referential constraints here too.

Typical Syntax - `CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE`
Schema Syntax - `CREATE TABLE COMPANY.EMPLOYEE`

Order of Attributes is kept same as the way it was created. Meaning employee(empno, fname, lname, post, ssn) will remain that way. This is useful for insertions etc..


## Attribute Data Types & Domains 

|Data Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Integer|Stores whole numbers without decimal places.|INT, SMALLINT|
|Floating-Point|Stores decimal numbers with floating decimal places.|FLOAT, REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION|
|Decimal|Stores decimal numbers with specified precision and scale.|DECIMAL(10,2), NUMERIC(8,3)|
|Character String|Stores fixed or varying-length strings of characters.|CHAR(10), VARCHAR(255)|
|Bit String|Stores fixed or varying-length sequences of bits.|BIT(8), BIT VARYING(16)|
|Boolean|Stores true/false or unknown values.|BOOLEAN|
|Date|Stores dates (year, month, day).|DATE|
|Time|Stores times (hour, minute, second).|TIME|
|Timestamp|Stores dates and times with precision, including fractions.|TIMESTAMP|
|Interval|Stores intervals or durations of time.|INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH|

Examples:

- Integer: `INT`: 10, -5, 0
- Floating-Point: `REAL`: 3.14, -0.5, 1.0
- Decimal: `DECIMAL(10,2)`: 12345.67, -9876.54
- Character String: `VARCHAR(255)`: 'Hello', 'John Doe'
- Bit String: `BIT(8)`: B'10101010', B'11001100'
- Boolean: `BOOLEAN`: TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN
- Date: `DATE`: '2023-06-01', '2022-12-31'
- Time: `TIME`: '14:30:00', '08:15:45'
- Timestamp: `TIMESTAMP`: '2023-06-01 14:30:00', '2022-12-31 23:59:59.999'
- Interval: `INTERVAL DAY TO HOUR`: +5 12:00, -3 04:30


## Specifying Constraints

Basic constraints that can be used when creating tables. 

### Attribute Constraints 

|Constraint|Desc|Use|
|--|--|--|
|`NOT NULL`|Doesn't allow attribute to be NULL, Default applied to PK|`FNAME VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL`|
|`DEFAULT <VALUE>`|If no value is inserted then assigns the default value|`RESPONSE INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 404`|
|`CHECK`|Restricts value to a range of values. In ex. Dnumber is limited to 1-20. |`Dnumber INT NOT NULL CHECK (Dnumber > 0 AND Dnumber < 21)`|

Check can also be used while creating a domain by doing `CREATE DOMAIN D_NUM AS INTEGER CHECK (D_NUM>0 AND D_NUM<21);`
Domain is a datatype for an attribute which enforces rules.


### Key and Referential Integrity Constraints

|Constraint|Desc|
|--|--|
|`PRIMARY KEY`|Specifies one or more attributes that make up the primary key|
|`UNIQUE`|Specifies Secondary key enforcing uniqueness on the attribute|
|`FOREIGN KEY`|Specifies Referential integrity. Allows linking attributes of one relation to PK of another relation|
|`RESTRICT`|Rejects the update/delete operation that would result in a violation ex: `ON DELETE RESTRICT`|
|`SET NULL`|Sets a value to null when referenced tuple is deleted or updated ex:`ON DELETE SET NULL`|
|`CASCADE`|Deletes referencing tuple when referenced tuple is deleted or updated ex:`ON DELETE CASCADE`|
|`SET DEFAULT`|Sets a value to default when referenced tuple is deleted or updated ex:`ON DELETE SET DEFAULT`|
|`CASCADE ON DELETE`|Deletes all referencing tuples when referenced tuple is deleted|
|`CASCADE ON UPDATE`|Updating all referencing tuples when referenced tuple is updated|


#### Check Clause

- Constraints can be specified using the CHECK clause within CREATE TABLE statement.
- CHECK constraints are tuple based constraints.
- Checking is done during insertion or modification.
	EX: We can use them to check wether a manager's start date is later than that of the department.
- CREATE ASSERTION can be used to define more general constraints.
