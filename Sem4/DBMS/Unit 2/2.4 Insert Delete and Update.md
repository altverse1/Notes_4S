## Insert

Used for adding a single tuple. Values should be listed in the order in which the table is created.
ex: 
```sql
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES ( ‘Richard’, ‘K’, ‘Marini’, ‘653298653’, ‘1962-12- 30’, ‘98 Oak Forest, Katy, TX’, ‘M’, 37000, ‘653298653’, 4 );
```

We can also explicitly specify the attributes we wish to insert to
ex:
```sql
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (Fname, Lname , Dno , Ssn ) VALUES (‘Richard’, ‘Marini’, 4, ‘653298653’);
```
Attributes that are not mentioned here will be set to DEFAULT or NULL
All the the NOT NULL specification attribute must be included. 

### Combining Insert and Select
While creating a temporary table we can use INSERT along with SELECT to insert values.

```sql
CREATE TABLE temp_workson_info
(
	emp_name VARCHAR(15),
	proj_name VARCHAR(15),
	hours_per_week DECIMAL(3,1)
);
INSERT INTO temp_workson_info VALUES 
SELECT e.lname, p.pname, w.hours
FROM project p, workson w, employee e
WHERE p.pnumber = w.pno AND w.essn = e.ssn
```

If we update the referred tables the info will not show up in temp_workson_info for that feature we need to create VIEWS.

## Delete

It removes a tuple from a relation. It can be paired up with WHERE, to remove all tuples matching a certain condition. 
Only one table is targeted, but if we was constraints then other tables will be affected.

Without WHERE clause the all the tuples in the relation gets wiped.

Ex: 
```sql
DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Lname =‘Brown’; 
DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Ssn =‘123456789’; 
DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Dno =5; 
DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE;
```


## Update 

Updates attribute of one or more selected tuples. WHERE is used to select the tuples needed to be updated. SET clause is used to set the new values.
Updating primary key can result in changes(deletion, automatic updation, nullification) in other relations if proper referential constraints are set.

Ex:
```sql
-- Change the location and controlling department number of project number 10 to ‘Bellaire’ and 5
UPDATE PROJECT SET Plocation = ‘Bellaire’, Dnum = 5 WHERE Pnumber =10;

--Give all employees in the ‘Research’ department a 10 percent raise in salary if they belong to department 5
UPDATE EMPLOYEE SET Salary = Salary * 1.1 WHERE Dno = 5;
```
