Informal guidelines for relational databases are practical measures to assess the quality of relation schema design.

### Guideline 1: Imparting Clear Semantics to Attributes in Relations

- Design relation schemas so that their meaning is easily understandable.
- Group attributes based on the real-world entities or relationships they represent.
- Avoid mixing attributes from different entities or relationships in a single relation.
- Clear attribute semantics enhance the interpretation and explanation of the relation.

### Guideline 2: Reducing Redundant Information in Tuples and Update Anomalies

- Design schemas such that insertion, deletion and modification anomalies are near to zero.

### Guideline 3: Minimizing NULL Values in Tuples

- Avoid including attributes in a relation that frequently have NULL values.
- NULL values can waste storage space and complicate query operations.
- If NULLs are unavoidable, ensure they apply to exceptional cases rather than the majority of tuples.

### Guideline 4: Disallowing the Possibility of Generating Spurious Tuples

- Design relation schemas that allow joining based on appropriate (foreign key, primary key) pairs. 
- Avoid matching attributes that are not (foreign key, primary key) combinations, as they may produce spurious tuples.
