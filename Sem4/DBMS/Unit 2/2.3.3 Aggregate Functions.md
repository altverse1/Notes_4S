Aggregate functions are used to sum the information into single tuple summary. 

Types:
- COUNT - Returns the number of tuples.
- SUM 
- MAX
- MIN
- AVG

SUM, MAX, MIN, AVG can be applied on multiple numeric values. 
All these functions can be used in SELECT or HAVING clause.

>[!question]
>Find the sum of the salaries of all employees, the maximum salary, the minimum salary, and the average salary.
>>[!answer]-
>>```sql
>>select SUM(salary), MAX(salary), MIN(salary), AVG(salary) 
>>from employee;
>>```


>[!question]
>Find the sum of the salaries of all employees of the ‘Research’ department, as well as the maximum salary, the minimum salary, and the average salary in this department.
>>[!answer]-
>>```sql
>>select SUM(salary), MAX(salary), MIN(salary), AVG(salary) 
>>from (employee JOIN department on dno = dnumber)
>>where dname = 'Research';
>>```

```sql
-- Retrieve the total number of employees in the company.
SELECT count(*)
FROM EMPLOYEE;

-- Retrieve the number of employees in the ‘Research’ department.
SELECT count(*)
FROM (EMPLOYEE JOIN DEPARTMENT ON dno=dnumber);
WHERE dname='Research';
```


Count(Distinct SALARY) can be used to discard duplicates. 
Generally NULL values get discarded by aggregate functions. 

```sql
SELECT Lname , Fname 
FROM EMPLOYEE 
WHERE ( SELECT COUNT ( * ) FROM DEPENDENT WHERE Ssn = Essn ) >= 2;
--counts the number of dependents that each employee has; if this is greater than or equal to two, the employee tuple is selected
