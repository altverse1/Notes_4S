## ER to Relational Mapping Algorithm
  
The steps for **mapping** an ER schema to relations in a relational database can be summarized as follows:

1. **Regular Entity Types:** Create a relation R for each regular entity type E, including its only its simple attributes(even of their composite attributes). Choose one of the key attributes as the primary key.
	==Ex: If a relation EMPLOYEE is created with SSN, name , address ..... then a key is chosen as Primary, i.e. SSN.==
    
2. **Weak Entity Types:** Create a relation for each weak entity type, including its simple attributes. Include the primary key attribute(s) of the owner entity type(s) as foreign key(s) in the weak entity's relation.
	==Ex: When a weak entity type like DEPENDENT is created then the primary key of the owner i.e. EMPLOYEE is used as the foreign key.==
    
3. **Binary 1:1 Relationship Types:** 
	- **Foreign Key Approach:** Choose one of the entity types and include the primary key of the other entity type as a foreign key in it. 
	- **Merged Relation Approach:** Merge the two entity types and the relationship into a single relation. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Possible only when both tables will have same number of tuples at all times.</mark>
	- **Cross Reference Approach:** Create a separate relation to cross reference the primary keys of two entity types S and T. The primary keys of S and T will be foreign keys of the new relation.
	
4. **Binary 1:N Relationship Types:** Include the primary key of the "one" side entity type as a foreign key in the "many" side entity type's relation.
	==Ex: The PK of Departments(1-Side) table is a FK in Employees(N-side). ==
	
5. **Binary M:N Relationship Types:** Create a separate relation to represent the relationship. Include the primary keys of the participating entity types as foreign keys in the relationship relation. Also include any simple attributes that can give more information about the relationship. ==Ex: The Works_On relation is used to relate the Employees and Projects relation. This is done by introducing the PK of both the tables as FK in Works_On. The attribute Hours gives info about the time spent by employee on the each project.==
    
6. **N-ary Relationship Types:** Create a separate relation S to represent the n-ary relationship. Include the primary keys of the participating entity types as foreign keys in the relationship relation. Any simple attributes of the relationship should be added to S to capture more information.
    

These steps help in translating the conceptual ER model into relational database tables, ensuring that the relationships and attributes are properly represented and the integrity constraints are maintained.
