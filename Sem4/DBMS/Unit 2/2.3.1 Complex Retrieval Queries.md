
## Comparison of Null and Three Valued Logic

SQL uses NULL to represent missing values.
NULL value can exist for the following reasons:
1) **Unknown**: The person's DOB is not known so we put NULL
2) **Unavailable**: The person gave the driver's exam and the license number hasn't come yet so we put NULL
3) **Not applicable**: College degree of a person would be NULL if the person hasn't attended any college in the first place.

 NULL regardless of the reason is NULL for SQL.
SQL uses Three Valued Logic, i.e. True, False and Unknown. Instead of Boolean.

If NULL value is involved in comparison the result is UNKNOWN. 
The result of combinations of TRUE, FALSE & UNKNOWN values using logic connectives is : 

Table A) 

|AND|TRUE|FALSE|UNKNOWN|
|--|--|--|--|
|True|True|False|Unknown|
|False|False|False|False|
|Unknown|Unknown|False|Unknown|


Table B)

|AND|TRUE|FALSE|UNKNOWN|
|---|---|---|---|
|True|True|True|True|
|False|True|False|Unknown|
|Unknown|True|Unknown|Unknown|

Table C)

|NOT|RESULT|
|--|--|
|True|False|
|False|True|
|Unknown|Unknown|


We use IS and IS NOT as the comparison operators when dealing with NULL values. 
Ex: 
```sql
SELECT fname, lname
FROM employee
WHERE super_ssn IS NULL;
```


## Nested Queries, Tuples and set/multiset comparison

Queries requiring values to be fetched from the database use nested queries. Comparison operators are used withing the WHERE clause of another query.  

Things to remember:
- Nested queries are complete SELECT-FROM-WHERE blocks within the WHERE clause of an outer query.
- Nested queries are used to fetch values from one or more tables based on specific conditions.
- The result of a nested query can be a single value, a single attribute, or a set of values.
- The IN operator is commonly used in nested queries to check if a value exists in the result of the inner query.
- Comparison operators such as = ANY (or = SOME), > ANY, >= ANY, < ANY, <= ANY, <> ANY, and ALL can be used to compare a single value with a set or multiset of values.

Ex: 
```sql
-- Retrieve distinct project numbers from the "PROJECT" table where the project is managed by an employee with the last name 'Smith' or where the project has an employee with the last name 'Smith' working on it.
SELECT DISTINCT Pnumber FROM PROJECT 
WHERE Pnumber IN 
( SELECT Pnumber 
 FROM PROJECT , DEPARTMENT , EMPLOYEE 
 WHERE Dnum = Dnumber AND Mgr_ssn = Ssn AND Lname =‘Smith’ ) 
 OR
 Pnumber IN 
 ( SELECT Pno 
 FROM WORKS_ON , EMPLOYEE 
 WHERE Essn = Ssn AND Lname =‘Smith’ )

-- Select distinct essn from works on where employees have same (project,hours) combination as john smith with essn = 123456789.
SELECT DISTINCT Essn 
FROM WORKS_ON 
WHERE ( Pno , Hours ) IN 
( SELECT Pno , Hours
 FROM WORKS_ON 
 WHERE Essn =‘123456789’ );

-- Return the names of employees whose salary is greater than the salary of all the employees in department 5.
SELECT Lname , Fname 
FROM EMPLOYEE 
WHERE Salary > ALL --can use any too you see!
( SELECT Salary 
 FROM EMPLOYEE 
 WHERE Dno =5 );

```

> [!question]
> Retrieve the name of each employee who has a dependent with the same first name and is the same sex as the employee 
> >[!answer]-
> >```sql
> >select e.fname, e.lname 
> >from employee e
> >where e.ssn in
> >(select d.essn 
> >form dependent d 
> >where d.sex=e.sex AND d.dependent_name=e.fname)
> >```

To avoid any ambiguity, we used alias.


### Correlated Nested Queries

When an nested query relies on an attribute of the outer query we say correlation is present. Nested query is executed for each tuple(like comparing multiple times) or a combination of tuples of the outer query.

Correlated nested queries can always be rewritten as single block queries. The single block query combines the tables involved in the nested queries and specifies the correlation condition in the WHERE clause.

```sql

SELECT E.Fname, E.Lname
FROM EMPLOYEE AS E
WHERE E.Ssn IN (
    SELECT Essn
    FROM DEPENDENT AS D
    WHERE E.Fname = D.Dependent_name AND E.Sex = D.Sex
);
	|
	| --Can Be Written as: 
	|
	V
SELECT E.Fname, E.Lname
FROM EMPLOYEE AS E, DEPENDENT AS D
WHERE E.Ssn = D.Essn AND E.Sex = D.Sex AND E.Fname = D.Dependent_name;

```

Both queries have the same functionality, but the correlated nested query executes the nested query multiple times based on the tuples in the outer query, while the single block query combines the tables and incorporates the correlation condition within the WHERE clause.


## Exists and Not Exists Functions in SQL

EXISTS is used to determine if a correlated nested query returns any tuples or not. 
It's syntax is: `EXISTS (sub query)`
NOT EXISTS  is the negation of the EXISTS. Returns True if result is empty and FALSE if result is present. 

EX: 
```sql
-- Retrieve the name of employees who do not have dependant.
SELECT Fname, Lname
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM DEPENDENT
    WHERE Ssn = Essn
)
```

> [!question] 
> List the name of managers who have at least one dependent
> >[!answer]-
> >```sql
> >select e.fname, e.lname 
> >from employee e 
> >where exists 
> >(select * from dependent d where d.essn=e.ssn) 
> >AND exists 
> >(select * from department d where d.mgr_ssn = e.ssn )
> >```

Each tuple from the outer query is used and the ones that are true by both exists statements is displayed. 

```sql
-- Select name of employee who are assigned to all projects with Dnum = 5.
SELECT fname, lname
FROM employee
WHERE NOT EXISTS
	((SELECT pno FROM projects where dno=5) -- Not Correlated
	EXCEPT
	(SELECT pno FROM works_on WHERE ssn=essn)); -- Correlated

```
In the above EXCEPT acts like a minus operation and NOT EXISTS result in a True if nothing is returns from the nested queries.


## Explicit Sets and Attribute Renaming

- It is possible to use explicit set of Values in the WHERE clause instead of nested query.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT essn
FROM works_on
WHERE pno in (1,2,3)
```
The above selects employees with SSN who work in projects 1, 2 or 3.  

- It is possible to rename attribute that appears in the result of a query.

```sql
SELECT E.Lname AS Employee_name , S.Lname AS Supervisor_name FROM EMPLOYEE AS E , EMPLOYEE AS S WHERE E.Super_ssn = S.Ssn ;
```
Here employee's Lname attribute gets renamed to Employee_name and name of the supervisor's Lname selected gets renamed to Supervisor_name.
