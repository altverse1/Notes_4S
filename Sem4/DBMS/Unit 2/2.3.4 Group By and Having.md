## Group By

Group BY is used to partition a relation into non overlapping subsets(groups) of tuples on the basis of some attributes called grouping attributes(specified in SELECT).

Aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN can be used with groups of tuples independently. 

>[!question]
>For each department, retrieve the department number, the number of employees in the department, and their average salary.
>>[!answer]-
>>```sql
>>SELECT Dno, COUNT ( * ), AVG ( Salary ) 
>>FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY Dno ;
>>```

The above works by partitioning the employee into groups based on their department. Then applying count and avg function on the group of tuples. 

If NULL exists in the grouping attribute then a separate group will get created with the grouping attribute.


>[!question]
>For each project, retrieve the project number, the project name, and the number of employees who work on that project.
>>[!answer]-
>>```sql
>>SELECT pnumber, pname, count(*) 
>>FROM project, works_on 
>>WHERE pnumber=pno
>>GROUP BY pnumber, pname;
>>```

## Having

Having clause is used together with Group By on the summary information of grouped tuples. It basically allows us to filer based on certain criteria. 

>[!question]
>For each project on which more than two employees work, retrieve the project number, the project name, and the number of employees who work on the project.
>>[!answer]-
>>```sql
>>select pnumber, pname, count(*) 
>>from project, workson
>>where pnumber=pno
>>group by pnumber, pname
>>having count(*)>2
>>```

WHERE clause limits the tuples to which functions are applied, the HAVING clause serves to choose whole groups.

>[!question]
>For each project, retrieve the project number, the project name, and the number of employees from department 5 who work on the project
>>[!answer]-
>>```sql
>>select pnumber, pname, count(*)
>>from project, workson, employee
>>where pno=pnumber and dno=5 and snn = essn
>>group by pnumber, pname
>>```
>>Output:
>>```
>>|Pnumber | Pname | count(*) |
>>|--------|------------|---------| 
>>|1 | Project A | 2 |
>>|2 | Project B | 1|
>>```

```sql
--Count total number of employees whose salaries exceeded 40k in each department who have more than 5 employees working in them.

select dname, count(*)                 --|This 
from employee, department              --|Is 
where dno=dnumber and salary>40000     --|Wrong
group by dname                         --|
having count(*)>5;                     --|

-- The correct one is:
SELECT Dnumber, COUNT(*) 
FROM DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE 
WHERE Dnumber = Dno AND Salary > 40000 AND Dnumber IN (
    SELECT Dno 
    FROM EMPLOYEE 
    GROUP BY Dno
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
)
GROUP BY Dnumber;
