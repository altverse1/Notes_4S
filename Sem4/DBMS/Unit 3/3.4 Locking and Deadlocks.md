>Briefly explain the two-phase locking protocol used in concurrency control.

The Two-Phase Locking (2PL) protocol is a concurrency control technique used in Database Management Systems (DBMS) to ensure the serializability of transactions. The protocol consists of two distinct phases that transactions must adhere to in order to maintain data consistency and prevent conflicting accesses. The goal is to guarantee that the final outcome of concurrent transactions is equivalent to some serial execution of those transactions.

**Expanding Phase:** During the expanding phase, a transaction is allowed to acquire locks on data items but is prohibited from releasing any locks. This means that a transaction can continue requesting and acquiring locks on various data items it needs to access, either for reading or writing, but it cannot release any locks it has already acquired. This phase ensures that once a transaction releases a lock, no further interactions with other transactions can be affected by that transaction's actions.

**Shrinking Phase:** After a transaction acquires all the necessary locks during the expanding phase, it enters the shrinking phase. In this phase, a transaction can release the locks it has acquired, but it cannot request or acquire any new locks. Releasing locks means that a transaction is done with the corresponding data items, and other transactions can now access those items.

The key idea behind the Two-Phase Locking protocol is to prevent two transactions from acquiring conflicting locks that could lead to data inconsistencies. By enforcing this protocol, the system ensures that transactions do not interfere with each other in a way that could violate the integrity of the data or produce incorrect results. It prevents situations like the lost update problem or uncommitted data being read by other transactions.

Furthermore, adhering to the Two-Phase Locking protocol guarantees that the schedule (order of execution of transactions) is serializable, which means that the end result of concurrent transactions will be equivalent to some sequential execution of those transactions.

>When deadlock and starvation problem occur? Explain how these problems can be resolved.

**Deadlock:** Deadlock occurs when multiple transactions are waiting for resources (locks) held by other transactions, leading to a situation where none of the transactions can proceed. In other words, each transaction is stuck waiting for a resource that is locked by another transaction, creating a circular dependency.

**Starvation:** Starvation, on the other hand, is a situation where a transaction is unable to make progress because it's constantly being postponed or delayed in favor of other transactions. Essentially, certain transactions may keep acquiring resources, causing others to wait indefinitely, which can lead to a transaction not being able to complete even though it's perfectly valid.

**Resolving Deadlock:**

1. **Deadlock Prevention:**
    - Lock Hierarchy: Require transactions to acquire locks in a predefined order to prevent circular waiting.
    - Lock Timeout: Set a maximum time for which a transaction can hold a lock, forcing it to release the lock after a certain period.
    - No Waiting: If a transaction cannot acquire a lock immediately, it is aborted, reducing the chances of deadlocks.
    - Resource Allocation Graph: Maintain a graph that shows the relationships between transactions and resources. Deadlocks can be detected by identifying cycles in this graph.

2. **Deadlock Detection and Recovery:**
    - Wait-for Graph: Maintain a graph representing the wait-for relationships between transactions. Detect cycles in this graph to identify deadlocks. Resolve deadlocks by aborting one or more transactions in the cycle.
    - Timeout: Set a timeout for each transaction. If a transaction doesn't complete within the timeout, it's assumed to be deadlocked and is aborted.


**Resolving Starvation:**

1. **Fair Scheduling:**
    - Use a fair scheduling algorithm that ensures that every transaction gets a fair chance to acquire resources, preventing some transactions from monopolizing resources.
    - Aging: Give priority to transactions that have been waiting for resources for a longer time. This prevents a transaction from waiting indefinitely.

2. **Resource Release:**
    - Implement a policy where a transaction that has held a resource for a long time is more likely to release it when requested by other transactions.
    - Timeout: If a transaction has been waiting for a resource for an extended period, force it to release the resources it holds. This prevents long-standing transactions from causing others to wait indefinitely.
