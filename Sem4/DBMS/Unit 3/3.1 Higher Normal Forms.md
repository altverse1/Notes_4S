## Higher Normal Forms

### Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

> [!info] Def
> A relation is in BCNF if whenever a non trivial functional dependency X -> A holds in R then X is a Superkey of R.

BCNF is a rule that tells us how to organize our data to avoid problems. 
Say that we have a relation about student, courses and teachers. 
If {student, course} -> Teacher i.e. a combination of student and course in the relation can determine the teacher, BCNF tells us to separate these attributes into different relations to avoid errors.

Hence we divide it into two relation {student, courses} and {courses, teacher}.


### 4NF

> [!info] Def
> A relation schema R  is in 4NF wrt to a set of dependencies if for every nontrivial multivalued dependency X->->Y, X is a Superkey for R.

X->->Y means X multidetermines Y. 


#### Multivalued Dependency

They are the consequence of 1NF (Bars us from having attributes with a set of values.)

Since 1NF bars us from having multiple values in a set under the same attribute for a tuple. We have to resort to having separate tuples with different values for the said attribute. If we have many such attributes that are multi valued we have no choice but to write them in separate tuples for the sake of consistency. This results in many such tuples for a single attribute linking them all. 

Assume a relation.
Say that we have an employee working on two projects and has 2 dependents linked to each project. Since a single attribute cant have a set of values, we have to make the table like this (below) to maintain consistency.

|Emp Name|Pname|DependantNAME|
|--|--|--|
|Smith|X|John|
|Smith|Y|Anna|
|Smith|X|Anna|
|Smith|Y|John|

####
-------------

A relation that is not in 4NF due to non trivial MVD has to be decomposed to convert the set of relations into 4NF.

The process is to convert each MVD is represented as a separate relation.

For the above example we have to break the relation down into two like below:

|Ename*|Pname*|
|--|--|
|Smith|X|
|Smith|Y|

|Ename*|DependantNAME*|
|--|--|
|Smith|John|
|Smith|Anna|


### 5NF

>[!info] Def
>A relation schema R is in 5NF (Project-join normal form) with respect to set F of functional Multivalued and join dependencies if, for every non trivial join dependency JD(R1,R2,.....,Rn) is implied by F, every Ri is a Superkey of R.

#### Join Dependency
Its a constraint applied to a set of related tables. It specifies that data in those tables should be such structured in such a way that they can be combined without loss of information whenever requested.

Ex: Say a schema has relations supplier, parts and projects. The dependency might specify that whenever a supplier provides a part and that part is used in the project, then that supplier must also provide that same part for that project. i.e. a join dependency JD(R1,R2,R3) is specified among the three projections.

In a 5NF schema the data is organized in a way that these complex dependencies are properly maintained and every part of the data remains important and accurate.
