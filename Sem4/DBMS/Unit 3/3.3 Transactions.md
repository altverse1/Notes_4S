They are the basic database operations. They are:
- Read_item(X) Reads a database item named X.
- Write_item(X) Writes the value of program variable X into the database item named X.

 >[!info] Interleaving
 >Interleaving, in the context of databases and transactions, refers to the concurrent execution of multiple transactions or operations in an overlapping manner.
 

## Need of concurrency Control 
Say that for an airline reservation, two transactions are taking place simultaneously. 
![[_excalidraw_/dbms_norm.excalidraw.md#^group=AyC8QWVtanx7NWHGt--eZ]]


### The lost update problem

If T1 and T2 are submitted at approx same time and their operations are interleaved like the above. Then final value of X is incorrect as T2 reads the values of X before T1 updates it and updates the values after T1. So transaction made by T1 is lost. 

### Temporary Update problem/ Dirty Read Problem

When on transaction is updating a value say some error occurs which leads to partial updation. This can lead to further errors if another transaction tries to access this before any attempts are made to recover it to its original state.

### Incorrect Summary Problem

Say one transaction is calculating an aggregate of some items in the DB while another transaction is updating one of these items. The aggregate resulting from these operations will not be up to date as some values will be those that were there before the update and some would be after.

![[_excalidraw_/dbms_norm.excalidraw.md#^group=A0_G4W3o3Vt4YB4NO8269]]

### The Unrepeatable Read Problem

Occurs when a transaction has to read an item multiple times.
Say a transaction T reads an item and another transaction Tn changes it after which T reads it again. T receives the updated value which can cause errors in its processes.

Ex: When the customer decides on a particular flight, the transaction then reads the number of seats on that flight a second time before completing the reservation, and it may end up reading a different value for the item.


## Desirable Properties of Transactions (ACID)

Transactions must have these properties:

- **Atomicity**: Transaction must be a single indivisible work. If it starts it must complete else it must not start in the first place.
- **Consistency**: The database if is in a consistent state before the transaction then it must remain so after the transaction.
- **Isolation**: Transaction must run independently of each other. Changes made by one transaction must not be visible till it is committed.
- **Durability**: Once transactions are committed they become permanent. The recovery subsystem must ensure it.



## Characterizing Schedules based on Serializability

Can be classified as serial, non serial and conflict-serializable schedules.

- **Serial Schedules**: Imagine two people booking airline tickets at the same time. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If there's no mixing of their actions</mark>, we have two possibilities: <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Either one person finishes</mark> their booking first and then the other person does, <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">or vice versa</mark>. These straightforward scenarios are called "serial schedules."
![[_excalidraw_/dbms_norm.excalidraw.md#^group=sFMqY12TqwTFkYEabvklu]] 
>Figure A 

- **Non Serial Schedules**: Now if we allow two peoples booking actions to overlap then complications may occur. 
![[_excalidraw_/dbms_norm.excalidraw.md#^group=JBuSRE8ZS1_reUl1sN_sv]]
>Figure B

In the above non-serial Schedule no errors occur. However in the one below error will occur
![[_excalidraw_/dbms_norm.excalidraw.md#^group=AyC8QWVtanx7NWHGt--eZ]]
>Figure C


The advantage in using non serial schedules is that it allows for concurrency, allows the CPU to do more and the general experience is much faster. But they can lead to issues. Like if two people tried to change their seat number at the same time etc.


### Serializability

It's a concept. It says that a schedule S with n transactions is serializable if it's equivalent to some serial schedule of the same n transaction.

The two schedules are called **result equivalent** if the produce the same final state of the database. Ex: Figure A  and B

**Conflict Equivalence:** Two schedules are said to be conflict equivalent if the order of any two conflicting operations is the same in both schedules. 

**Conflict Serializable**: A schedule S is said to be conflict Serializable if it is conflict equivalent to some serial schedule SJ.



### Testing conflict serializability of a Schedule 

By the use of the following algorithm we can test serializability. The algorithm looks at the read and write operations only. It constructs a precedence graph which is a directed graph G=(N,E)

**Algorithm**: Testing conflict serializability of schedule S

1.For each transaction Ti participating in schedule S, create a node labeled Ti in the precedence graph.

2.For each case in S where Tj executes a read_item(X) after Ti executes a write_item(X), create an edge (Ti → Tj ) in the precedence graph.

3.For each case in S where Tj executes a write_item(X) after Ti executes a read_item(X), create an edge (Ti → Tj) in the precedence graph.

4.For each case in S where Tj executes a write_item (X) after Ti executes a write_item(X), create an edge (Ti → Tj) in the precedence graph.

5.The schedule S is serializable if and only if the precedence graph has no cycles.
