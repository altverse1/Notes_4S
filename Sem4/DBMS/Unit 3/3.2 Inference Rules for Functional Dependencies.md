The set of all dependent that include F as well as all dependencies that can be inferred from F are called closure of F; it is denoted by $F^{+}$

or expanded def.

The closure (Denoted by $F^{+}$) of a set of functional dependencies (F) includes all the dependencies that are originally given in F, as well as any additional dependencies that can be logically deduced from the given dependencies.


Ex:
```
F = {Ssn → {Ename, Bdate, Address, Dnumber}, Dnumber → {Dname, Dmgr_ssn}}
```
we can logically deduce that `Ssn->{Dname, Dmgr_ssn}` and `Dnumber->Dname`.

F|= X->Y => Means the functional dependency X->Y is inferred from the set of functional dependencies F.


### 6 Rules

- **IR1 (Reflexive rule):** If X ⊇ Y, then X -> Y.
- **IR2 (Augmentation Rule):** If {X->Y} |= XZ -> YZ.
- **IR3 (Transitive Rule):** {X->Y, Y->Z} |= X->Z
- **IR4 (Decomposition or Projective Rule):** {X->YZ} |= X->Y
- **IR5 (Union or additive rule):** {X->Y, Y->Z} |= X->YZ
- **IR6 (Pseudo transitive rule):** {X->Y, WY->Z} |= WX->Z

#### Proofs 
**Proof IR1:**
	Suppose that X ⊇ Y and that two tuples t1 and t2 exist in some relation instance r of R such that t1\[X] = t2\[X].
	Then t1\[Y] = t2\[Y] because X ⊇ Y; hence, X -> Y must hold in r.

**Proof IR2:**
Assume that X -> Y holds in a relation instance r of R but that XZ -> YZ does not hold.
Then there exist two tuples t1 and t2 in R such that:

t1\[x] = t2\[x]---------------------(i)
t1\[y] = t2\[y]---------------------(ii)
t1\[xz] = t2\[xz]---------------------(iii)
t1\[yz] ≠ t2\[yz], ---------------------(iv)
This is not possible because from (i) and (iii) we can deduce 
	t1\[z] = t2\[z] ---------------------(v)
	and from (ii) and (v) we deduce 
		t1\[yz] = t2\[yz] ---------------------(vi)
	 contradicting (iv)
	 
**Proof IR3:** Assume that 
(1) X → Y and 
(2) Y → Z both hold in a relation r. Then for any two tuples t1 and t2 in r such that t1\[X] = t2\[X], we must have
(3) t1\[Y] = t2\[Y], from assumption (1); hence we must also have (4) t1\[Z] = t2\[Z] from (3) and assumption (2); thus X → Z must hold in r. 

**Proof IR4** (Using IR1 through IR3). 
1. X → YZ (given). 
2. YZ → Y (using IR1 and knowing that YZ ⊇ Y). 
3. X → Y (using IR3 on 1 and 2). 

**Proof IR5** (using IR1 through IR3). 
1. X →Y (given). 
2. X → Z (given). 
3. X → XY (using IR2 on 1 by augmenting with X; notice that XX = X).
4. XY → YZ (using IR2 on 2 by augmenting with Y). 
5. X → YZ (using IR3 on 3 and 4). 

**Proof IR6** (using IR1 through IR3). 
1. X → Y (given). 
2. WY → Z (given). 
3. WX → WY (using IR2 on 1 by augmenting with W). 
4. WX → Z (using IR3 on 3 and 2).

## Three Algorithms

### Algorithm 1

**Definition:** If you have this set of attributes X and a given set of functional dependencies (F), $X^+$ (i.e. closure of X under F) can be determined by X based on F.

#### Algorithm 1: Determining $X^+$ 

```
Input: F (fd on a relational schema R) and set of attributes X (subset of R)

X+ := X;
repeat
	old X+ := X+;
	for each functional dependency Y->Z in F do:
		if if X+ ⊇ Y then X+ := X+ ∪ Z;
until(X+ = old X+)
```

Example: 
F = { Ssn → Ename, Pnumber →{ Pname, Plocation }, {Ssn, Pnumber } → Hours }

![[_excalidraw_/dbms_norm.excalidraw.md#^area=ufD99WGCZpn12ydnpScs-]]

Using Algorithm, we calculate the following closure sets with respect to F:
{Ssn}+ = { Ssn, Ename }
{Pnumber}+ = { Pnumber, Pname, Plocation }
{Ssn, Pnumber}+ = { Ssn, Pnumber, Ename, Pname, Plocation, Hours}


### Algorithm 2:

#### Equivalence of set of functional dependencies

- A Functional dependency F is said to cover another set E if every FD in E is also there in $F^+$
- Two sets of FDs E and F are said to be equivalent if $E^+ = F^+$. Therefore every FD in E can be inferred from F and vice versa. Here E covers F and F covers E.

#### Minimal Sets of functional dependencies
- Minimal cover is the set of functional dependencies E for a set F that satisfies the property that every dependency in E is in closure F+ of F.

#### Algorithm 2: Finding the minimum cover F for a set of FDs E

```
1. Start with a set of functional dependencies E.
2. Create a set F and assign it the same functional dependencies as E.
3. For each functional dependency X → {A1, A2, ..., An} in F:
    - Replace it with individual functional dependencies X → A1, X → A2, ..., X → An.
4. For each functional dependency X → A in F:
    - For each attribute B in X:
        - Create a new set of functional dependencies F' by removing X → A and adding (X - {B}) → A.
        - Check if F' is equivalent to F (meaning they cover the same set of dependencies).
        - If they are equivalent, replace X → A with (X - {B}) → A in F.
5. For each remaining functional dependency X → A in F:
    - Create a new set of functional dependencies F' by removing X → A.
    - Check if F' is equivalent to F.
    - If they are equivalent, remove X → A from F.
```

Example:
Given set of FDs be E: {B → A, D → A, AB → D}. We have to find the minimal cover of E.

All above dependencies are in canonical form (that is, they have only one attribute on the right-hand side), so we have completed step 1.

Step 2 we need to determine if AB → D can be replaced by B → D or A → D?

AB → D may be replaced by B → D. We now have a set equivalent to original E, say E': {B → A, D → A, B → D}.

Step 3 we look for a redundant FD in E'. By using the transitive rule on B → D and D → A, we derive B → A. Hence B → A is redundant in E' and can be eliminated.

Therefore, the minimal cover of E is {B → D, D → A}.


#### Algorithm 2a Finding Key K for R. Given a set F of Functional Dependencies

```
Input: A relation R and a set of functional dependencies F on the attributes of R. 
1. Set K := R. 
2. For each attribute A in K 
	{compute (K – A)+ with respect to F; 
	if (K – A)+ contains all the attributes in R, then set K := K – {A} };
```
